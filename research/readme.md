# Overview

The research/ subdirectory includes the following folders (that have been committed to git):  
* data/  
* src/  

## data

The data folder contains all data used to generate a demo dataset for development purposes. Please see additional documentation contained in the data/ subdirectory. Broadly, the data/ subdirectory includes:  
* Documentation regarding raw data from data sources (including IHME, OIE, G-Finder, and GAVI)    
* Processed data to be used for the development of a demo site. Note that the processed data contained in the data/ subdirectory include both actual (processed/aggregated from raw data sources) and notional (simulated) data.  

## src

The src folder contains the scripts used to process raw datasources, simulate notional data, and aggregate results. It also contains an html document that provides some additional documentation regarding the function of the data processing code. Note that this html document has not been fully formatted/processed, and is intended for internal use only to highlight the function of the data processing code contained in the .Rmd file.

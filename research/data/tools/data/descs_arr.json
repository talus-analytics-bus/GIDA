A fourth operation was subsequently added in 2015 to better align it with the government's reform program and the World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) cycle, to provide the much needed response to a deteriorating macroeconomic context and to strengthen the impact of the supported reforms. This programmatic series of four operations is anchored in the Armenia Development Strategy (ADS) for 2014–25 which was approved by the government in April 2014, and in the CPS for FY2014–17. Originally, the Program Development Objective (PDO) of this DPO series was to support job creation through growth enhancing reforms. However, given the country's increasing macroeconomic and fiscal vulnerability in the context of a worsening external environment, the PDO was amended (in the third operation under this programmatic series) to support the government's reform agenda under the following two pillars: (i) promoting fiscal, social, and environmental sustainability; and (ii) strengthening competitiveness. These reforms will ultimately bolster the prospects for the government's long-term objective of job creation. The first pillar includes measures to increase the fiscal space, improve the financial sustainability of key sectors, enhance the efficiency of social protection programs, and improve environmental safeguards in the mining industry, which accounts for over half of Armenia's exports.

In the last decade, Bahia has improved its economic performance and achieved a remarkable track record in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Nonetheless, Bahia still lags behind national averages and continues to be the state with the largest absolute number of poor and extreme poor in the country.

Our project in Georgia addresses barriers faced by the PWUD community related to their sexual and reproductive health and rights. Driven by community champions, we work to realize PWUD activists and community initiatives are able to influence the government through an established mechanism; a supportive policy environment exists with the political will to change legislation and to meaningfully involve civil society and PWUD; and service delivery done by NGOs is financed by the government and international donors. Georgia is among low HIV prevalence countries being at high risk for an expanding epidemic due to widespread injecting drug use and the population movement between Georgia and neighbouring high HIV prevalence countries such as Ukraine and Russia. Since 1997 the number of newly registered cases started to increase and Georgia is one of those very few countries in the world and in the region where the HIV incidence has been increasing steadily during the last decade. The latest available evidence indicate that the HIV epidemic in Georgia is largely concentrated among key populations, including PWUD for which the estimated HIV prevalence is 2.2%. Another major problem is the late HIV diagnosis and its association with a high mortality rate and the major multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB burden. Despite the impressive expansion of HIV prevention efforts over the last several years, coverage of key populations with preventive services and HIV testing remains low for all key populations. It should be highlighted that the state programme does not procure 4th generation HIV tests, which identify HIV positive cases earlier. There are no services addressing the specific needs of young people (between the ages of 14 and 24) who are vulnerable and most at risk of HIV in Georgia. Stigma and discrimination of people living with HIV continues to be a major barrier to HIV prevention and service utilisation. Negative social attitudes and low public awareness also remain obstacles, especially for PWUD. Besides societal attitudes, state criminal laws, regulations, and policies relevant to drug use and preventive work among IDUs and prisoners are among limiting factors. Despite the accomplishments in various areas of national HIV response, the epidemic continues to grow.","AFEW is uniquely positioned as one of the few HIV, TB, hepatitis and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) organisations working in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. This is a region where the work is critical, as HIV and sexually transmitted infections are on the rise, sexuality education is deficient and gender-based violence goes largely unrecognized. Further, cases of multidrug resistant and extensive drug resistant tuberculosis are increasing; and there is a very high prevalence of hepatitis C. The group with the highest risk for HIV and HIV related diseases are people who use drugs. However, transmission through sexual contact is increasing and the prevalence among women and men who have sex with men is increasing.","We believe that the end of AIDS is possible if there is more focus on key populations. Our project in Kyrgyzstan addresses barriers faced by the PWUD community related to their sexual and reproductive health and rights. Driven by community champions, we work to realize a more supportive drug policy; a strong PWUD community that is respected by society and the government; and increased access to high-quality services for (young) PWUD. The Kyrgyz Republic is a country with low HIV prevalence in the general population. However, between 2006 and 2015, the number of officially registered cases of HIV infections in the country rose 5.7 times to a total number of 6,402 people living with HIV. Key populations carry a heavy burden of the epidemic, for example the HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID) is 12,4%. Injecting drug use is the primary driver of HIV infection in the Kyrgyz Republic, where more than 50% of HIV infections occur in PWID. One of the reasons that there has been some increase is the limited access to prevention programmes and healthcare for key populations. For the last four years, the overall political situation in Kyrgyzstan has been fragile and dynamic at the same time. The year 2014 was marked by a troubling trend in the country, as the government failed to promote and consolidate political and civil rights that many had hoped would follow the 2010 constitutional reforms and change of government. The rise of religious and radical nationalistic movements has led to sporadic cases of discrimination and violence against key populations. The spring of 2016 brought long-awaited positive changes, when the country’s parliament finally declined a draft law on“foreign agents”due to strong political pressure.","We believe that the end of AIDS is possible if there is more focus on key populations. Our project in Tajikistan addresses barriers faced by the PWUD community related to their sexual and reproductive health and rights. Driven by community champions, we work to realize integrated and structured systems of services for PWUD financed by the government; increased access to justice; humanisation of the Criminal Law; NGOs have access to prisons and increased access to services and treatment for PWUD (male, female, young, migrant and in prison). Tajikistan is among the countries where HIV prevalence has increased by more than 25% over the last 10 years, though it still manages to keep the epidemic in a concentrated stage (less than 1% of the general population). Tajikistan is at the early stage of an HIV/AIDS epidemic, with an estimated 16,000 people living with HIV at the end of 2015. Although the proportion of new HIV cases diagnosed among PWID seems to have fallen dramatically over time (down to 22.4% in 2015), PWID still bear a disproportionate number of HIV infections. Sexual transmission increased, it seems that this is linked to partners and sexual spouses of People who Inject Drugs. HIV prevalence in prison increased and varied from 6.2% in 2005 to 8.3% in 2015. Most of the prisoners are PWUD. In Tajikistan the number of sterile needles and other commodities per PWID per year is still very low. OST covers only 1% of the total PWUD community. In prisons, there is no access to OST treatment. Tajikistan suffers from corruption, low capacitiy of local agencies to analyse newly introduced reformed and programmes and there is insufficient government budget for health and preventive medicines. PWUD also face economic barriers, such as increasing poverty , migration and returning migrants, unemployment, and access to finance. PWUD face high levels of stigma and discrimination often in small controled communities. Women are often economically dependent on husbands and other family members.","We believe that the end of AIDS is possible if there is more focus on key populations. Our project in Ukraine addresses barriers faced by the PWUD community related to their sexual and reproductive health and rights. Driven by community champions, we work to realize strong collaboration with civil society; meanginful involvement in coordination council; transforming qualified specialists into activists; increased awareness, motivation and skills of PWUD to demand human rights; decriminalization of drug use; and access to high quality health services and comprehensive packages of services for (young) PWUD. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ukraine has been growing since the early 1990s among key populations. The HIV epidemic observed in Ukraine is the second largest HIV epidemic among Eastern European and Central Asian countries. During the last five years, progress in HIV response and a decreasing HIV rate among several key populations has been achieved with technical and financial support from international donors. However, HIV prevalence is still high with 21.9% among PWID. Since 2009, the Ukrainian state took financial responsibility for ART but not for the comprehensive country HIV response. In early 2014 Ukraine was hit by socio-economic and political crisis with the occupation and annexation of the Crimea. The ongoing war in Eastern Ukraine has caused many people to leave non-Ukraine controlled territories amid high violence, crises in access to food and accommodation, and massive human rights violations. It has become hard or almost impossible for KPs in rebel-controlled territories to get opioid substitution therapy (OST), harm reduction services and ART. War and waves of internally displaced people (IDPs) have led to shortages in domestic funding, and pushed HIV response down to the lowest priority for state and local governments.","Objectives of the action are:(i) To build the capacity of primary care doctors and family physicians to function in support of community-based primary care teams and to improve the quality of PHC services.(ii) To build the capacity of family physicians to offer effective leadership and clinical governance to PHC facilities.(iii) To evaluate the contribution of family physicians to strengthening district health services.","To improve access to and quality of rural maternal and child health services by integrating the provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) into maternal, new-born, child and women's health (MNCWH) services.","To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of school health teams in Umkhanyakude District, rural KZN Province, which can serve as a pilot for other rural districts.","Improving maternal and child health by increasing the quality of, access to and utilisation of maternal and newborn child health (MNCH) services in Vhembe and Sekhukhune districts of Limpopo Province.",null,"Financial and System audit.

The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs is funding PSI to test two innovative models, and two theories of change, to tackle youth and adolescent sexual health issues (2016-2020). The market development approach implemented by PSI in the DRC, Haiti and Mozambique consists in addressing market failures that prevent Sara from accessing the contraceptive products and services she wants and needs. Main approaches used include a thorough landscape analysis to understand how the market is failing Sara (production to use spectrum analysis). This helps ensure that the response is highly context-specific and that programs in each country are geared towards prioritized market players to address the failures identified. PSI also uses user-centered design inspired techniques to gather consumer insights and develop fast prototypes. The Ecosystem development approach, implemented by Triggerise in India and Kenya, consists in improving health the livelihood of micro-entrepreneurs who are incentivized to improve access to contraceptive products and services.

Social marketing strategies are employed to influence behaviour of all 12 million men and women in the sexually active and reproductive age of 15-49 years, especially of 3 million men engaging in risky sex and 1.2 million women who don’t want to become pregnant but do not yet use any contraceptives. The Social Marketing-concept uses a nationwide network of wholesalers and retailers that sell different types of condoms of the brand Jeito for different prices. Promotional campaigns influence behaviour. At the end of this activity at least 81 million condoms will be sold (about 67% of all condoms sold commercially in Mozambique) and 4 million freely distributed. To improve the use of Sexual and Reproductive Health counseling and services, including family planning and safe abortion services, PSI uses a network of 400 activistas who interact with population in communities, adolescents in schools. The population can be referred to a network of TEM+ clinics, 30 of these are public facilities, and 10 are private. In public facilities SRH services are free. To ensure no one is left behind, a total market approach is employed which includes targeted subsidies for those who cannot afford to pay for condoms and SRHR services. Behaviour change information and communication through media and by‘activistas’and health workers is expected to lead to increased informed demand from youth, men and women for sexual and reproductive health services, counseling and commodities.

If successful the project should result in reduced maternal disability and death through early detection of potentially dangerous pregnancies. The automatic detection software is the most innovative part of the project. The anticipated business model is described as a fee per scan model.The project will:1. train midwives to use this basic ultrasound device,2. collect these ultrasound image data and use them to design software that assists midwives to use the device properly and automatically detect gestational age and potentially dangerous situations like placenta previa, breech and multiple pregnancies.","Applicants tackle the last kilometers in the delivery of medical goods to health posts in Ghana, which is often hampered by the bad condition of roads by creating a custom-made unmanned aerial system (drone) for the transport of essential medical goods (both for emergencies and for stock supply) by air from a hospital to a (remote) health post. Once functional, this system will address access to better SRHR and to drugs/vaccines to combat poverty related diseases. The technical goal is to produce a functional prototype and test it in Ghana. Meanwhile, business models for future production, exploitation and maintenance of drones are investigated. Other partners focus on (flight) rules and  local acceptance. This project is part of a larger Master Plan.","BLISS4Midwives is part of the TNO programme BLISS and aims to combine existing point-of-care diagnostics into one suitcase-like modular device that will allow midwives in Ghana to test on the spot whether a pregnant woman suffers from eg. (pre)eclampsia and possibly other complications. The device is also fitted with a (tablet) screen and software that provide user instructions and decision support (whether a referral to hospital is needed). The project aims to produce 10 prototypes and train at least 20 midwives in the use of it. The device will be tested in Ghana on at least 500 pregnant women.","Pneumonia is the leading cause of child mortality under five, resulting in 1.1 million deaths annually. The partners in this project are working on a cost-effective technology that will support health workers at the Bottom of the Pyramid to accurately assess fast breathing rate in children under 5 and support a better diagnosis of pneumonia: the Childrens Automated Respiration Monitor (ChARM). The device will provide clinical decision support to frontline health workers during their diagnosis of pneumonia and support the prescription of antibiotics for only those children that have fast breathing.","PharmAccess, Kwara State Government and Hygeia have been working together with local communities and traditional leaders since 2007 to implement the Kwara State Health Insurance Programme. A major challenge has been building the capacity of the primary health care centres to deliver sexual and reproductive health care and treatment for poverty-related diseases. To address the human capacity issues of the primary care centres, mHealth solutions involving telemedicine and medical call center will be established. Primary care centers in rural Kwara will be linked to district hospitals, which will be connected to the teaching hospital and the specialized medical center in Ilorin (capital of Kwara State) and Hygeia hospitals in Lagos.","A feasibility study to examine viability of a high quality maternal and newborn health package including technologies and services. The activities will be concentrated around the Dhulikhel Hospital, a not-for-profit, non-government tertiary level hospital, that runs 18 primary level Outreach Clinics and also provides (para)medical training services.  The catchment population is the approx. 179 thousand women of the reproductive age and newborns living in the districts of Kavrepalanchok and Sindhupalchok, of which over one fifth (21,69%) is living in poverty.","Early detection is the most promising strategy to reduce the enormous worldwide burden of tuberculosis (TB). The partners in this project have developed a breakthrough technology, CAD4TB, software that automatically provides information about patients who should proceed with the more expensive and time-consuming X-ray test. The demonstration will include a complete platform called CAD4TBCloud that can be used with any digital X-ray machine anywhere in the world, running  locally and in the cloud.

Most of these deaths could be avoided if adequate obstetric care was available and accessible. Additionally according to UNFPA/WHO estimates for every woman who dies from complications related to childbirth approximately 20 more suffer from injuries infections and disabilities that can result in temporary or lifelong social and economic exclusion. The main and most important causes of the maternal mortality and morbidity and infant mortality is the lack of adequate healthcare services, including a need for both health infrastructure (healthcare facilities equipment etc) and skilled human resources.The Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso recently created six new health district to bring healthcare closer to the population. Five of these new districts have been selected for the project because they currently do not have a the facility for comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care. These five health districts are the districts of Mangodara in the Cascades Region (southwest Burkina Faso) the districts of Karangasso-vigué and Lena in the Hauts-Bassins Region (also southwest) and the districts of Manni and Gayéri in the Eastern Region.","The Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) - MMV’s mission is to reduce the burden of malaria in disease-endemic countries by discovering, developing and delivering new, effective and affordable antimalarial drugs to cure and protect vulnerable populations.","DNDi’s mission is to improve the quality of life and the health of people suffering from neglected diseases using an alternative model to develop drugs for these diseases and by ensuring equitable access to new and field-relevant health tools.","The TB Alliance’s mission is to dramatically impact the tuberculosis pandemic by developing new, significantly improved, faster-acting and affordable TB treatments that are available to those who need them.","IPM’s mission is to provide women with safe, effective and affordable products they can use to prevent HIV and protect their sexual and reproductive health.","In Moldova, young people face various health challenges which are currently not adequately addressed by health services.

The outbreak is the largest the world has ever seen and WHO estimates up to 20,000 cases over the next six to nine months without intensified control measures. Following the announcement the WHO formally requested Australian support to assist with the WHO consolidated appeal to respond to the outbreak. Through the WHO Ebola response roadmap which identifies immediate needs and priorities, funding under this investment contributes to Australia's response to the Ebola outbreak and will provide support for human resources and medical expertise, logistics, supplies and equipment and food and water for those in affected regions. The total value of this investment is $12.0 million expensed in the 2014-15 financial year.","In Ethiopia there is a significant, though relatively small, market demand for camel milk by two groups: local ethnics (mainly in Addis) and local health groups. At present the milk is brought raw from the (far) country side, which bears high risks of freshness and hygiene. The project will be located in Debre Berhan where the partners will set up a nucleus farm (200 ha) with camels and cows. In addition, they will work with about fifty nomadic smallholders/shepherds. The applicant is a Kenyan company, established and run by a German expert. The local partner and the applicant together will set up a joint venture. The project aims to produce good quality, preserved camel and cow milk and sell it to local consumers and in the wider region (Somalia and Northern African countries). The applied pascalisation technology is based on killing of germs (as heat does) through excessive pressure and is supposed to result in a longer shelf life for the milk (cooled at least 25 - 40 days), to fix more vitamins, unsaturated (healthy) fats and important enzymes while its taste is very close to fresh, raw milk. Furthermore, pascalisation is less energy consuming than pasteurisation or sterilisation and will be HALAL certified.","Applicant HEAP Research BV is specialised in the development of medical services in emerging markets. Local partner Medison Ltd owns and operates a number of privatized outpatient clinics in Georgia. The partners will set up a joint venture according to Georgian law. The project will be located in one of the local partner's medical centres in Tbilisi.In cooperation with a team of medical specialists from the Academic Medical Centre (AMC) in Amsterdam, rehabilitation centre Roessingh in Enschede and the HEAP/Artmed clinic in Yerevan, Armenia, the partners plan to open a clinic with a comprehensive approach to rehabilitation care. The focus of the clinic will be on patients suffering from orthopaedic trauma, stroke, and cerebral palsy. The concept is completely new to Georgia. Patients in need of the care offered by the new joint venture now have to go abroad to receive treatment. In practice, most of them receive no professional care at all. Nineteen physicians, three doctors and a number of nurses will be trained and supported by professionals from leading institutions in the field of rehabilitative care in the Netherlands. In total, the project will create 38 new jobs.","The partners will establish a facility in Laos to produce herbal food supplements and cosmetics.Currently, Laos sells a lot of herbs to Vietnam and China and imports a lot of finished herbal products.The partners are already active in the herbal sector. The applicant Greater Pharma Company Ltd from Thailand is producing herbal medicines in Thailand and the local partner Viengthong Pharma Company Ltd distributes (herbal) medicines and medical equipment in Laos including products of the applicant. Partners know each other well and have all the knowledge and experience to implement the project.The partners will establish a joint venture that will be located in Vientiane.The project will work with at least fifty outgrowers to secure the year-round supply of the required herbs. This is new for the country where, currently, a lot of herbs are collected in the forests.The project will add value to the herbs in Laos and will introduce the GMP standard in the herbal industry. It will be the first Laos producer of herbal food supplements and cosmetics.","Quinine is processed and marketed into various derivatives and alkaloids. The processing is fairly sophisticated and there is only a limited number of production units in the world.The production outside Europe is mainly concentrated in Indonesia and India. Indonesia has two extraction facilities, Kimia Farma and PT SiL. Arnold Suhr Netherlands has an exclusive co-operation with Kimia Farma.However, the production facility of Kimia is situated in the heart of the city of Bandung and the Indonesian government has decided that the location in Bandung should be closed. Therefore, the applicant Arnold Suhr Netherlands and the local partner Bionexx are interested in the establishment of an extraction unit in combination with investments in new plantations in Madagascar in order to better control the quality of the bark (which is presently mainly produced in DR Congo) and to create a sustainable growth of the supply of bark.Main activity of the project will be the processing of cinchona bark into quinine derivates for the international market. Initially, a limited part of the bark will be obtained from local production in Madagascar, a major part will still be imported. Local production will be actively promoted under the project through training and technical advice in the establishment of cinchona plantation and the establishment of nurseries for improved cinchona seedlings in the area of Fianarantsoa where the Artemisia processing plant of the local partner is located. The quinine processing plant will have a capacity of 1,400 Mtons of cinchona bark a year to produce 73 Mtons of totaquina (the quinine precursor). The capacity of the nursery to be established will allow the production of 150,000 seedlings annually for the plantation of 75 ha.","In Bolivia there is no possibility to obtain an MRI scan at the internationally required standard level of 1.5 Tesla. Only a few MRI scanners can be found, using outdated technology up to 0.35 Tesla. Low resolution MRI means low quality, as such less functional for most medical indications. Details are missed, about 75% of the injuries cannot be diagnosed by these low-quality MRI. The investments in high-end MRI scans however are too expensive for most hospitals. This project will provide a solution by starting a diagnostic MRI service centre with two mobile MRI units to be parked next to hospitals or outpatient clinics. The centre will provide online diagnostic reports and pictures to the referral doctors, who can deliver medical advice to their patients. Cost of the service will be paid by insurance companies, private hospitals or the patients themselves. The joint venture will work with a social pricing system to assure access also for the poorest people, as a result prices will range between € 1 to € 150 per scan. The company will have a maximum capacity of 9,000 MRI scans and diagnostic conclusions per year. The centre will be based in La Paz and the mobile units will rotate within the poorer neighbourhoods of La Paz, El Alto and surrounding villages. The joint venture company is formed between Hospital Arco Iris in La Paz and Qmed BV of the Netherlands. Through this MRI diagnostic centre the health sector of Bolivia will be uplifted, enabling better medical diagnostic conclusions.","The applicant, Advanced Processes Inc., is a US firm established in 1998, employing fifteen staff. Advanced Processes Inc. is specialised in waste processing and electricity generation. The local partner Caltech Ventures, is a Ghanaian firm established in 2005. Currently, Caltech grows cassava for production of cassava flour but in the near future also for production of ethanol. Caltech owns 3,400 ha of land of which 250 ha has been planted with cassava. The partners plan to generate renewable energy from cassava waste and municipal waste in the Volta region. The partners will set up a joint venture with equal shareholding and will establish a 600 kW waste to energy plant. The power produced by the joint venture will be sold to the national electricity provider and to Caltech. This will be the first gasification plant in Ghana. Cassava waste will be collected from cassava farmers and municipal waste will be sorted and briquetted at the local landfill site. The electricity off take is guaranteed by the Public Utility and by the local partner. Fertiliser pellets will be produced as a by-product and will be sold to Caltech and other agro-communities.","Colombian applicant Centro de Ortodoncia y Ortopedia Maxilar y Rehabilitación Oral S.A. and local partner Asistencia de Servicios Empresariales y Financieros S.A. are both dental clinics. In Nicaragua and other Latin American countries, dentists face shortages of high quality dental prostheses such as crowns, teeth and implants. As a result, these products are imported from the United States at a high cost for patients. At the same time, Nicaragua boasts well-skilled labour and a lack of technical job opportunities. The partners have identified the business opportunity to establish the first advanced dental laboratory in Nicaragua that will substitute imports by producing high quality dental lab products at a lower cost.The company will create 62 jobs in Nicaragua, of which 70% is medium and high-level and 60% are women. Through collaboration with the Association for Persons with Physical Disabilities, 10 technical positions will be filled by persons with reduced physical abilities, a group that is facing strong discrimination in the job market. The joint venture will implement an intensive training programme and introduce new technology in Nicaragua. Growth after the project is expected, with reinvestments that result in total employment of 97 persons (79 medium&high-level). Partners will establish a joint venture. The project will bring new technology to Nicaragua and dental products will become available at a more affordable price than imported products. Furthermore, the project will generate medium and high level jobs for people with a technical background.","Poultry consumption is on the rise in Nepal, although still low compared to neighbouring countries. An estimated 230 million chicken are raised in backyards every year. Seventy percent of the total stock dies in the rainy season due to avian flu (AF) and Newcastle disease (ND). The major poultry farms (producing another 70 million chicken) are able to vaccinate their stock. Because Newcastle vaccines are thermos-unstable, they cannot be used in remote areas where the majority of Nepal's rural population lives. Paid for by the Australian Government, a thermo stable ND vaccine was developed in Australia. This vaccine survives thirty days of tropical temperatures and is affordable for smallholders. The local partner, Intrepid Nepal Pvt. Ltd is a company of thirty highly qualified employees that focuses on Molecular Diagnostics Platforms. Their area of work is detection of pathogens, human and animal. One of their activities is epidemical research. In this way, they got a clear picture of the ND problem and decided to produce this thermos-stable vaccine using the Australian seeds, that are non-commercially available. In the poultry production chain, such a vaccine is the missing link. As this is to be the first commercial production of a vaccine from this seed, the Australian government is eager to facilitate this by providing expertise and seeds free of costs. USAID and an NGO have already pledged to buy thermos-stable vaccine for seven million chicken and resell them to smallholders. The business includes diagnosing whether it makes sense to vaccinate in a certain area, determining the ND strain rampant and the production of the vaccine itself. In order to get sufficient starting capital, they were introduced to the applicant by Dutch businessmen active in Nepal. The applicant, Aleven BV, is an asset manager that invests on behalf of his Dutch clients in food and health related companies in Nepal, Georgia and the Philippines. The other project partner, One to Watch BV, is a developer of Nepali companies active in food and health. The three partners will start a joint venture that enables Intrepid to start the production of vaccine on their premises.","Pork meat is widely consumed in Uganda however the sector is not organised and underdeveloped. Modern husbandry techniques are lacking and the small rural farmers are keeping pigs with genetics originating from breeds imported almost twenty years ago. This project will address two opportunities which have been reported for the pig sector in Uganda: 1) Pig breeding and pig multiplication centres - the growing foreign community in Uganda has increased the demand for pork and bacon and 2) Abattoirs for pigs. The production and sales of (premium quality) pork meat targeting the foreign and upper class of Uganda is the projects' main activity. The partners are convinced that the first critical steps of progress in a country like Uganda would be improving production techniques with improved (and not top-end) genetic material and building a know-how base. Applicant, SUIN, from Belgium is involved in pig production since 1995. The company's founder has developed a special pig breed called Duroc d'olives and runs a closed pig farm with 1,200 sows producing fattening pigs. Local partner, Greenfields, from Uganda has a successful track record of over ten years in the fishery sector through a previous PSOM Tilapia project. Third partner Marc Thyssen is a Belgian agricultural engineer experienced in the animal feed business and in meat processing. Together, the three partners possess all knowledge and experience needed to operate the new farm which will be Uganda's first AI centre, pig abattoir, breeding farm and special pig feed formulation laboratory. Animal Welfare conditions, implemented along EU standards, will get full attention through cooperation with a local Pig Farmers association and will be monitored by the International Livestock Research Institute.","Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector-borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe visceral form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans.This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease's emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi-country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence-based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio-cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will:-analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re-emergence of leishmaniasis;-assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries;-identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth-based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision-makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and,-improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three countries by strengthening cross-country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange.In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements), and tourists.Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease's emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision-makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities'explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision-makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan-American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi-sector prevention and control strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scaled up in other high-risk areas of the sub-region. The work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.","Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector-borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year.

The total NHS budget for Afghanistan is half the budget of, for instance, the Maastricht University hospital. As a result patients have to bribe their way into the health chain, from guard to surgeon, to receive medical treatment. Private practices are available, often run by the same doctors who work in the NHS hospitals. Patients who can afford it fly to India and Pakistan for treatment.The local partner is a medical doctor who established a small diagnostic clinic specialised in endoscopic diagnostics. Forty patients are treated daily for gastroenterological problems like ulcers etc.In 2006, he and the Dutch applicant planned to set up a small private hospital for digestive diseases (gastroenterology), providing diagnostics and treatment including operations. For the last six years, the partners carefully prepared for the establishment of the hospital. To provide for the management skills required, the local partner sent a family member to get a MBA in health care administration in India, and he himself worked for one year in Iran as head of a laboratory of a major hospital. Other family members were sent to different relevant courses. Gradually, he extended his network to other hospitals, mostly in India, to ensure possibilities for training and second opinion. In 2011, he acquired a plot to build the hospital. The core business is to be gastroenterology, but as these diseases are often related with other diseases, other medical specialists are required as well. As they are not available in nearby hospitals, these specialists will have to be recruited for this hospital on a freelance basis. Telemedicine facilities reduce the need for patients to go abroad for a second opinion. Average treatment costs an estimated € 60. The capacity of the hospital at the end of the pilot face is to be 2,000 patients per month.The applicant is by origin an Afghan medical doctor who is licensed in the Netherlands as a district nurse. He runs a health care company and concerns himself mostly with setting up the management of the hospital, training programmes for medical personnel and telemedicine facilities. The major part of training and telemedicine will be done by the Narayana Health Centre in Bangalore and specialists in Maastricht and Amsterdam pledged their support to contribute to this end as well.","Beef and dairy products are an important part of the Afghan diet. Local cattle is high in number but low on production. Cattle holders seek ways to improve their stock as they cannot meet local demand. Importing cattle is very challenging in a country like Afghanistan. NGOs and donor organisations set up small artificial insemination (AI) projects. This helped to some extend to improve livestock, but as funding is limited, it is not sustainable. The applicant has successfully set up AI businesses in forty countries, including developing markets. With an Afghan-Dutch national they elaborated a plan to approach the vast but challenging Afghan market. They contacted the local partner who runs a seed business and has many cattle owners as customer. Together with a cattle trading company they agreed on a business model. The core business is to provide imported semen to local cows and to breed a stock of improved Afghan bulls for local semen production. Insemination will be done by 50 employed and 100 free-lance inseminators. As there are virtually no veterinary services available, the joint venture will provide a comprehensive package including medication, improved feed and comfort products. Although there are some big cattle owners in Afghanistan, the main group of potential customers are small cattle holders. The majority of these small-owners are women who are culturally not allowed to work outdoors and selling milk is often their only source of cash income. They cannot be approached by male inseminators and therefore the joint venture will train at least 75 female inseminators. The joint venture aims to inseminate 0.5% of the total number of cows in Afghanistan in the first three years.","Ce projet multi-pays (Niger, Sénégal, Madagascar, République Centrafricaine) a pour objectif d'améliorer la prise en charge de la malnutrition aiguëmodérée en agissant sur les infections intestinales et en explorant les interactions entre malnutrition, immunitéet modification du microbiome intestinal (études clinique et biologique).","While there are many medical laboratories in Burundi, the quality of medical diagnostics in Burundi is negatively affected by frequent breakdowns of equipment, lack of access to advanced equipment and materials and lack of knowledge and experience among laboratory staff.The project will establish a Diagnostic Solutions Centre that will be able to provide: backup and advanced tests, services of installation-repair-maintenance combined with training of staff, rental of equipment and sales plus training packages for equipment. The clients for these tailored services will be the existing health structures such as hospitals, health centres, clinics and medical laboratories. The centre will be located in Bujumbura and will provide its services to the health structures in the city and will also organise a system of (refrigerated) collection of samples from health structures in the country. The partners Ibis-Pharma from Belgium and Socophar s.u.r.l. will enter into a joint venture. The project is expected to upgrade the diagnostics and so contribute to improved health care in Burundi. Since most medical equipment in Burundi is obtained by direct imports and donations, the after-sales service and staff training is usually poor and/or costly. The centre aims to fill this gap.","Ce projet a pour objectif de contribueràla réduction de la mortalitéet de la morbiditématernelle, néonatale et infanto-juvénile, grâceàla mise enœuvre d'un paquet d'interventionsàhaut impact en faveur de la mère, du nouveau néet de l'enfant dans le cadre de la continuitédes soins (7 pays dont le Niger).","The applicant has investigated the technology for harvesting anti-oxidants from olive mill waste water for some time. The anti-oxidants from olive mill waste water have a very high quality and are used in food, medicines and cosmetics as a health promoting ingredient. The world demand for these products is increasing. In contacts with the local partner the idea came up to implement the technology in the Palestinian Territories. This appeared a feasible idea so the plans were developed to start a project in the region. The project will be situated in Ramallah region. The applicant is Sana Pharmaceutical Research Company from Amman, Jordan and the local partner is Jerusalem Pharmaceuticals Company from Al Bireh, Ramallah. The partners will establish a joint venture company to implement the project.

De beoogde verwerkingsinstallatie is gebaseerd op scheiding van het afval met de innovatieve OREX-pers ontwikkeld door het Nederlandse bedrijf DB Technologies. Wereldwijd is dit een nieuw concept waarmee onder zeer hoge druk het afval  gescheiden wordt in een droge fractie en een natte, organische fractie. De droge fractie kan uitgesorteerd worden op plastics, papier, hout, metalen, etc. De natte fractie levert na vergisting biogas en compost op.Momenteel wordt het afval in  Dakar vrijwel volledig ongecontroleerd gestort op de regionale stortplaats die allang gesloten had moeten zijn. Het grote aandeel van organisch materiaal in het huishoudelijk afval vertegenwoordigt een hoge waarde aan (duurzame) energie die nu niet benut wordt.  De beperkte kosten van het nieuwe concept in vergelijking met alternatieve verwerkingsmethoden als verbranden, biedt een oplossing voor het probleem van Dakar.  Daarbij kan de regio Grande Dakar model staan voor de afvalproblematiek waarmee veel Afrikaanse metropoolsteden worstelen. De nieuwe techniek van DB Technologies is op een aantal plaatsen al in de praktijk bewezen maar tot nu toe nog niet in een ontwikkelingsland. Dat wil zeggen in situaties met een duidelijk andere samenstelling van het stedelijk/huishoudelijk afval, lage concurrerende verwerkingskosten van ongecontroleerd storten en met nog grotendeels te ontwikkelen afzetmarkten voor materialen en energie uit afval.De studie moet de financiële haalbaarheid aantonen van een eerste verwerkingsinstallatie voor 50.000 ton afval per jaar. Ter vergelijking bedraagt het huidige jaarlijkse afvalaanbod op de regionale stortplaats circa 600.000 ton. Na gebleken haalbaarheid kan in de toekomst gedacht worden aan een modulaire opschaling van de benodigde verwerkingscapaciteit of installaties op meerdere locaties in de regio wat mogelijk logistieke voordelen oplevert.Alvorens de businesscase kan worden opgesteld zijn een aantal deelstudies nodig. Ten eerste moet een kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve analyse van de samenstelling van het huidige afvalaanbod op de regionale stortplaats uitgevoerd worden. Ten tweede moet onderzocht worden welke afzetmarkten er bestaan voor materialen en energie uit de installatie zowel wat betreft huidige omvang van deze afzetmarkten, de gewenste kwaliteiten en potentiële opbrengstprijzen. Voor het biogas is de vraag welke route technisch en financieel het meest aantrekkelijk is zoals omzetting in een wkk naar elektriciteit, rechtstreekse afzet als stookgas in een industrieel proces, etc. Kwantitatief is compost het belangrijkste product en onderzoek naar de afzetmogelijkheden is dan ook van groot belang.  De compostmarkt lijkt daarbij nog nauwelijks ontwikkeld in Senegal. Met inzicht in het te verwerken afval en de gewenste productspecificaties van de outputstromen kan de technische lay-out van de installatie bepaald worden en zijn de materiaal- en energiebalansen van het proces bekend. Mede op basis van de berekende investerings- en exploitatiekosten wordt de businesscase geformuleerd in nauw overleg met Cadak-Car. Dit is de regionale overheidsorganisatie die verantwoordelijk is voor de inzameling en verwerking van het stedelijk afval in de regio en uiteindelijk beslist over een go/no go voor de realisatie van de installatie..De deelstudies worden uitgevoerd door LeapFrog Waste Management met waar nodig ondersteuning doorpartijen in Senegal zoals locale experts, onderwijsinstellingen, recyclingbedrijven en landbouworganisaties.

The project proposes 3 main components:1. a co composting facility in Techiman which will annually transform 6,000 m3 of faecal sludge from public toilets and houdeholds and 300 tons of organic urban solid wastes (including e.g. market waste) into 200 tons of safe (pelletized) compost under the brand name Fortifer. Drying beds are used fo primary treatment of the faecal sludge prior to co composting.2. A briquette plant in Afienya (Dangme West) to convert 3,300 tons per year of organic urban solid wast into 1,000 tons per year low cost fuel briquettes for use by business institutions and households3. The production of African cat fish and or fish feed in well treated waste water in Kumasi to create enough revenue to cover the operational and maintenance costs of the treatment ponds. In concept all interventions will be supported by capacity building activities of public and private sectors. The project creates direct employment for 200 people and more in the product distribution and retail chain primarily women.","The project aims at significantly improving the living conditions of 300,000 people in and environment of the Municipal Assemblies of Nsawam-Aodoagyiri, GA Central and GA West. This by treating approximately 50% of the estimated annual faecal sludge generation in these MAs. The project installs six 30-seater sanitation blocks (plus 4 after the project duration) and 3 Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTP) at the project locations. At the WWTP's, production facilities for biogas, fertilizer will also be established.","The project distinguishes four key problems to be tackled that would much contribute to an effective solid waste management structure:i) Limited SWM and waste recycling capacity.ii) Limited capacity of the local government (TMA) to provide adequate SWM services.iii) High unemployment and unsanitary conditions in targeted communities.iv) Shortage of electricity supply.The ultimate objective of the project is to reverse this downward spiral and generate electricity, improve SWM capacities (knowledge and know-how) and customer services and provide employment in the solid waste sector.The intervention strategy is to realise a sustainable Waste to Energy Plant that includes a Pre-Treatment and Materials Recovery Facility, Plastics Buy-Back Centres and Customer Care. The activities will deliver new jobs and training opportunities. Over eight thousand households will receive bags to sort out plastic waste at the household source and receive additional income from sales. Hygiene improvement will be accompanied by better working conditions of primarily waste pickers and by providing residents training in occupational health and safety and registration with National Health Insurance (including free vaccinations).","Currently, the Accra Metropolitan Area inhabits more than 1 million citizens and is the most densely populated administrative area in Ghana. The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) and adjacent municipalities presently dispose most of their faecal sludge directly and untreated into the sea at the Korle Gonno Lagoon and at the so-called Lavender Hill. The only wastewater treatment plant in the Metropolis (Mudor plant), north of the lagoon, is undergoing rehabilitation but is not suitable for bulk (truck) delivery of faecal sludges and only treats 15% of AMA sewage, mostly servicing the central business area and nearby areas. Other areas are served by on-site septic tanks and pit latrines, however a large proportion of the population of Accra still relies on non-sewage public toilets, on-site sanitation facilities or on open defecation.The present situation of very limited wastewater/sludge treatment leaves many areas in the Metropolis and surrounding areas ill-served with serious environmental effects on land and water quality, caused by high concentrations of biochemical contaminants. Accompanied by harsh living and working conditions under very poor hygienic circumstances, especially with the poor, this causes many health problems with regular outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.The Bola Bondeh project builds on the challenges in faecal sludge collection and disposal reducing the negative environmental impact and health hazards of dumping untreated liquid waste into the sea and other water bodies. Close to Lavender Hill, a wastewater treatment facility was installed in 2012 with a daily treatment capacity of 600 m3 sludge and has been in operation since. The Danish Development Cooperation Directorate DANIDA has issued approval to financially support the expansion of the facility to 800 m3 and build another on a nearby site for 800 m3 sludge treatment. For a final approval the conditions to be met are in a progressive stage.The scope of the underlying project lies with the treatment and re-use of excreta and environmentally sound disposal. Based on a supply chain and nutrient recycling approach the objectives of the project are to: Strongly reduce discharge of untreated wastewater in surface waters or sea around the Lavender Hill location Improve hygienic sanitation situation at community and household level in Jamestown Introduce simple and robust techniques for treatment of wastewater, urine and organic matter Develop private businesses in composting Use of compost as part of good agricultural practices (GAP) in (peri-urban) agriculture.","Le projet de l’association ALIMA, d’un montant total de 650 000 euros, viseàréduire la malnutrition et ses conséquences pour les enfants de moins de cinq ans.","Ce projet s'inscrit dans le cadre du plan d'action du programme sécuritééconomique de l'organisation au Nigeria pour l'année 2017 (environ 32 millions d'euros).

Indonesia is off track to meet MDG1. In fact, Indonesia ranks the fifth in world for the total number of children under five suffering from stunted growth and lags significantly behind other similar middle-income Asian countries in key nutrition indicators. Stunting prevalence among children under five years old (U5) was 37% in 2007 and it had only decreased slightly to 36% by 2010.  The percentage of underweight U5 old Indonesian children has remained stagnant at 18% since 2007.  In addition, maternal anemia is estimated at 44% and more than 11% of Indonesian children are born with low birth weights.  Low birth weight prevalence has actually increased in Indonesia during the 2000s. Therefore, actions are required to address the high rate of stunting in these districts, particularly by targeting the most vulnerable populations including pregnant women, neonates, infants, and young children.In this project Save the Children will contribute to this by building an Infant and Young Child Feeding IYCF programming model to address stunting including increasing demand for nutrition and health services; improving the availability and quality of those services; and improving household nutrition practices.  We will compliment this by working to enhance the enabling environment and the impact of services that do exist.  We will implement all actions through current structures so that good practices can be replicated.  Our targeted, multi-faceted, and intensive approach will allow us to share lessons learned throughout the two target districts and the East Java province in order to seek scale-up of promising actions principally by using public sector health and nutrition funding.

Indigenous peoples have the poorest health in the region, due to such factors as geographic isolation, limited access to safe water, sanitation and food, and a poor understanding of, and sensitivity to, cultural beliefs and practices. Among the indicators of greatest concern is the high rate of maternal mortality. Indigenous women consistently experience higher maternal mortality rates than non-indigenous women in Latin America.Efforts to improve maternal health for indigenous women and adolescent girls must be based on a clear understanding of how to provide and measure high-quality care that ensures adequate health outcomes with dignity. This project examines quality of care from a cultural and a technical perspective in three indigenous communities in Mexico, Peru, and Argentina. Each of these three case studies will explore perceptions of quality care among indigenous women, and will involve collection and analysis of data using a customized framework for quality of care indicators.The study will examine the implementation of integrated health service delivery networks in all the three countries. These networks are designed to coordinate different health providers and services and each country is implementing them differently. The three case studies will examine how the networks positively or negatively influence quality of care processes and outcomes. Results from the individual case studies and from the project as a whole are expected to inform strategies for scaling up efforts to improve quality of maternal care for indigenous populations.Expected outputs include scientific publications in Spanish- and English-language journals, and information sharing via community groups, the local press and social media.","Latin America is home to the greatest inequities in the world, including inequality in access to quality health services.

Many of these deaths are avoidable if symptoms such as high blood pressure, known as eclampsia, and associated challenges arising during pregnancy, are recognized and treated. This requires trained birth attendants and appropriate equipment for early and accurate detection.This project aims to test interventions that improve monitoring of pregnant women for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia - conditions that, if left untreated, can result in maternal and neonatal deaths. With the support of an existing mobile phone-based system, this project will provide education and practical skills to health workers for improved detection and management of these conditions. Mobile phones and other tools will capture and use real-time data related to maternal and child health.The evidence generated from this project will provide a scientific basis for integrating a targeted mobile health (mHealth) strategy to improve education, detection and management of eclampsia and pre-eclampsia. Findings from the study are also expected to support sustainable strategies to scale up the intervention from the eight districts included in the study.This project is part of the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa (IMCHA) initiative a seven year, $CA36 million multi-donor partnership funded by Global Affairs Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and Canada's International Development Research Centre.","This project will provide evidence that offers important insight into the connection between migration, gender, and forest dependence in rural Ethiopia.Need for labour migration, forest resourcesWhile most rural households rely on agriculture for their livelihood, many poor households in developing countries use labour migration and forest resources to improve their welfare. Existing research offers simplistic assumptions that migration invariably leads to deforestation in the tropics, and that forest recovery is always a consequence of people leaving rural areas.These assumptions are being questioned, particularly as researchers analyze and document the complex factors that influence migration outcomes. As a result, it is not clear whether labour migration complements, or serves as a substitute, for forest product extraction by migrant-sending households. Furthermore, whether and how labour migration influences intra-household gender relations, food security, and forest dependence at the places of origin is unclear.Insights into the effects on householdsThe Ethiopian Economic Association/Ethiopian Economic Policy Research Institute (EEA-EEPRI) will collaborate with the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) on this project. They will explore the effects of migration and remittances on household forest dependence, food security, and intra-household gender division of work.Researchers will investigate the degree to which those effects vary across different migration types (for example, domestic versus international migration, and rural versus urban) and across socio-economic groups and locations.A better understanding of these issues is of crucial importance in Ethiopia for a number of reasons. The government has formulated and implemented specific policies on gender, forestry, and food security. However, the ways in which rural out-migration is influencing the achievement of gender equity, forest conservation, and rural food security goals are not well understood.This research will aim to propose options for policymakers and development partners.Project leadershipThis project is made possible through the Think Tank Initiative (TTI). TTI is a multi-funder program dedicated to strengthening independent policy research institutions, or think tanks, in developing countries.

This mosquito is responsible for transmitting two viral diseases: dengue fever and chikungunya.Dengue and chikungunya interventions will be scaled up in three affected municipalities. Both diseases are responsible for rapidly growing health and economic burdens in the two countries. The project is expected to generate new knowledge on factors affecting policy adoption and scaling up:-institutional capacity gaps-early involvement and leadership of municipal players-good governance-costs-validating impact on disease incidenceThe evidence should help researchers and governments replicate the project at a larger scale. National and municipal governments and the World Health Organization are providing co-funding for the project.Food systems, healthy diet, and incentivesThe food systems and healthy diets study will take place in a rural municipality of Colombia. This region has one of the highest agricultural outputs in the country. However, it also has high rates of malnutrition among children and obesity in adult populations. The study will analyze local factors associated with the rise of obesity and diabetes, such as food systems and lifestyle determinants that favour unhealthy diets in rural areas.In the study's second step, researchers will pilot test an inter-sector approach. The aim is to promote municipal regulatory incentives for food and health systems, and community and workplace environments. Researchers will use a participatory methodology that involves multi-sector municipal committees, together with qualitative and quantitative methods.Testing ways to decrease diseasesThe project will analyze the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of scaling up interventions aimed at dealing with two emerging mosquito-borne diseases. The food and healthy diets study will analyze the basic food basket per home, family anthropometric indicators for nutritional status (underweight, stunting, etc.), feeding habits, and blood glucose levels.The project is expected to contribute to-stronger municipal players acting as public health leaders-effective scaled up solutions that decrease dengue and chikungunya incidence rates-municipal inter-sectoral approaches that contribute to preventing obesity and diabetes","As urban populations grow in developing countries, promoting inclusive growth that ensures food security for all is critical. This project will offer new insights into the informal food sector, and identify entrepreneurship and job opportunities for women and youth.Growth in urban populationsThe urban population in developing countries is expected to exceed 50% for the first time by 2020. Over the next 30 years, these cities will absorb 95% of urban growth. By 2030, they will be home to almost 4 billion people, or 80% of the world's urban population.As people move to the cities, there is a growing crisis of food insecurity. Food prices are high and incomes are low. Even in countries experiencing rapid economic growth, food insecurity is a major challenge. Within this context, the urban food economy is an important laboratory for examining whether and how inclusive growth strategies can have a positive impact by encouraging entrepreneurship, raising incomes, alleviating poverty, and mitigating the crisis of food insecurity.The Hungry Cities InitiativeThe goal of the Hungry Cities Initiative is to promote inclusive growth in the informal food sector through research on policy approaches that enable it, combined with measures that support entrepreneurship and decent employment. The Hungry Cities Initiative seeks to provide a global perspective on the links between three major transformation processes: rapid urbanization, the crisis of food insecurity, and the informal economy's emergence as the major source of livelihood for urban poor, including women and youth.The African Centre for Cities at the University of Cape Town (South Africa) and the Balsillie School of International Affairs at Wilfrid Laurier University (Canada) run the Hungry Cities Initiative. They work with five other Canadian universities, together with researchers and municipal governments in seven cities in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.How this research will make a differenceThe research team will analyze formal and informal urban food systems in the partner cities, how they interact, how they are governed, and their respective contribution to food security and inclusive growth.This project will:-provide evidence of entrepreneurial challenges and opportunities in the urban informal food system;-identify potential opportunities for women and youth to be incorporated as entrepreneurs and employees with decent jobs;-deliver knowledge through workshops, training, and consultations to inform policy and practice at the municipal level on enterprise development, entrepreneurship, and innovation in the informal food economy;-support 24 students (one post-doctoral, three PhD and 20 master's students) to develop research and collaborate with their Canadian peers; and-offer six policy workshops on urban food security and inclusive growth.The International Partnerships for Sustainable Societies program is funding this project. Team members from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean are largely supported by IDRC.

The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans.This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease's emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi-country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence-based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio-cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will:-analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re-emergence of leishmaniasis;-assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries;-identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth-based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision-makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and,-improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three countries by strengthening cross-country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange.In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements), and tourists.Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease's emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision-makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities'explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision-makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan-American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi-sector prevention and control strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scaled up in other high-risk areas of the sub-region. The work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.","Outside of Asia, Egypt is home to the greatest prevalence of avian influenza in the world. This research project will serve to strengthen Egypt's capacity to conduct avian influenza surveillance and control.Avian influenza in EgyptEgypt first responded to avian influenza through widespread culling. The consequences were catastrophic for backyard poultry and the livelihoods of poor households.Avian influenza is now interacting with bronchitis and other respiratory ailments, creating a shifting burden of disease that threatens the most accessible form of protein for many poor Egyptians.Improving surveillance and controlCairo University, the national government, and the poultry industry are working to enhance surveillance and control of these diseases through vocational training, mapping disease prevalence, and efforts to produce local vaccines.This project will allow the team to work with Canada's Poultry Health Research Network. The network is seen as a model for multidisciplinary approach and collaboration with industry. The grant will enable mutual visits between Cairo University and the Ontario Veterinary College.","One woman dies in childbirth in Tanzania every hour. With such high rates of maternal and newborn mortality, this project will address the problem by giving community health workers greater skills to assess and treat women, while extending the healthcare system's reach to rural women and newborns.Rural obstacles to better healthIn the Mara region of Tanzania, nearly 60% of births occur outside of health facilities. A high proportion of these births result in poor outcomes for the mother, newborn, or both. Reducing maternal and newborn deaths in Tanzania involves overcoming barriers to accessing rural healthcare facilities and improving access to quality community health care. These barriers include:-lack of qualified human resources-long distances to health facilities-high cost and poor availability of transportation-lack of knowledge of the risks related to non-facility births-cultural beliefs about avoiding professional careExtending health care's reachThe project team will train community healthcare workers to improve how they assess and treat women and infants, and extend health care to rural areas. They will evaluate interventions to improve antenatal care and delivery, such as prenatal vitamins and travel vouchers to get women to health facilities for screening of hypertensive disorders, HIV, and other conditions. Community health workers will use mobile phones to improve routine processes such as birth registration and monitoring stocks and workflows.The research team will generate evidence on sustainable interventions for delivering community-based primary health care in Tanzania that improves access to antenatal care and skilled delivery. They will focus on ways to enhance the knowledge and role of community health workers and to increase their use of mobile health (mhealth).The project will help guide policymakers at all levels of government to explore scaling up interventions that can improve outcomes for mothers and newborns.Project partnersThis project is part of the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa program.

This project will aim to reduce maternal and perinatal deaths by improving vulnerable women's access to healthcare services during and after childbirth.Access to care in NigeriaIn Nigeria, only 65% of women receive antenatal care during pregnancy. In areas of the country with the highest maternal and perinatal death rates, there are stark disparities in access to health care. For example, less than 10% of pregnant women in Sokoto and Kebbi States receive antenatal care and less than 5% have skilled care during delivery.For the most part, women's reasons for not accessing maternal health services include a lack of money to pay for health services, lack of transportation, perceptions about the negative attitudes of health workers, and lack of permission from husbands and other family members.Understanding the problemThis project will provide insight into the issue by identifying the supply and demand factors that influence improved access to maternal health care services in Nigeria, particularly for rural women. With this base, the project will develop an implementation plan to expand the work to six geo-political zones in Nigeria. The goal? To strengthen the availability and use of maternal primary health care services by vulnerable women.Maternal HealthThe Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa program is a seven-year $36 million initiative funded by Global Affairs Canada (GAC), Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).","The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria (Global Fund) was established in 2002 by the international community under the patronage of United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and works to attract and disperse additional resources to prevent and treat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.

In 2010 around 1.3 billion litres of diesel oil were burnt to keep these systems running in the Amazon , the same region where plans to build large dams for energy 'export' to urban centres prevail. Without suitable alternatives, they depend on supply of diesel oil, transported along hundreds of kilometres of roads or waterways, under a local scheme controlled by agents or authorities that exploit local populations through abusive trade and transport arrangements. Therefore there is a need to seek permanent energy solutions for the Amazonian populations that live far from the grid, in indigenous communities or small urban centres.The abundance of solar radiation, forests and rivers in the Amazon provides great potential for renewable energy sources such as biomass, solar, water or wind in the case of the indigenous land, Raposa Serra do Sol. This project aims to research the viability of renewable energy solutions that are decentralized, autonomous, efficient and easy to operate, which can lead to a decrease in fossil fuel energy dependence of indigenous communities and small urban centres in the Amazon. The results of this research will be used for advocacy purposes with the federal government to incorporate in its long term energy expansion programme ‘Luz para Todos’ (Light for Everyone). The areas selected are the regions where ISA is established at the local level, namely: Xingu, Raposa Serra do Sol and Upper Rio Negro. ISA started this project ‘Cruviana’ in March 2010, and has been working with CAFOD partner, CIR to assess wind energy potential in the indigenous land, Raposa Serra do Sol.

Une réserve budgétaire de 5,5 MEUR a été insérée pour la consolidation des acquis dans des secteurs ou sous-secteurs en exit, tel que celui de l’assainissement. La Belgique était en effet engagée dans ce secteur depuis 2002 avec la mise en œuvre du Projet d’Appui à l’Assainissement de la ville de Sikasso – PAS (évalué et clôturé en 2008) qui a notamment permis la construction du Centre d’Enfouissement Technique, seule décharge contrôlée du Mali, ainsi qu’un apport en expertise à l’opérationnalisation de la filière des déchets solides de Sikasso, via le PAEX, pour la collecte et la gestion des déchets dans les quartiers centraux de Sikasso (de 2012 à 2014).

Pour y arriver, la vision détermine des priorités parmi lesquelles « le développement du capital humain », et « la démographie ». Le Cadre Stratégique de Croissance et de Lutte contre la Pauvreté, phase 2, considère comme priorité l’axe « amélioration de l’accessibilité et de la qualité des services sociaux de base et le renforcement du socle de la protection sociale ». De plus, une Politique Nationale de Santé 2005-2015 a été adoptée suite aux Etats Généraux de la Santé. Cette politique est déclinée en Plans Nationaux de Développement Sanitaire quinquennaux. Le Plan actuel couvre la période 2011-2015.L’évaluation du Plan précédent a permis de constater des améliorations et la pertinence des réformes en cours comme la gratuité des soins pour les femmes enceintes et les enfants de moins de 5 ans. L’objectif sectoriel est d’assurer, d’ici à 2015, l’accessibilité de la population aux soins et à des services de santé de qualité. Le financement du Plan est évalué à 1.656 milliards de Francs burundais, qui devrait être couvert à hauteur de 43% par les bailleurs.La Belgique possède une grande expérience dans le secteur de la Santé au Burundi. Elle y est active depuis plusieurs années, dans différents domaines. Ces dernières années, elle met en œuvre le Programme PAISS « Programme d’Appui Institutionnel au Secteur de la Santé », qui s’articulent autour de différents volets. Chacun de ces volets s’ancre dans une Direction du Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Lutte contre le Sida. Les volets 1, 2 et 3 représentent un budget de 18 millions d’euros (dont 1 million de contribution suisse). Le volet 1 concerne l’Appui à la gouvernance au niveau central. Le volet 2 concerne l’Appui à la gouvernance sanitaire périphérique. Le volet 3 concerne l’Appui au développement des Ressources Humaines. Ces interventions ont débuté en 2011 et l’exécution se termine en mars 2015. Le volet 4 concerne l’Appui au Système National d’Information Sanitaire et a débuté en 2012.","Le Programme Indicatif de Coopération belgo-ougandais 2012/13-2015/16 prévoit un projet pluriannuel d’un montant de 8 MEUR d’appui aux institutions privées sans but lucratif, appelée PNFP, actives dans le secteur de la santé en Ouganda en vue d’y promouvoir une couverture sanitaire universelle.L’intervention vise spécifiquement à améliorer les prestations de services des structures sanitaires PNFP et à augmenter l’accès des patients à des soins de santé de qualité grâce à un partenariat public-privé renforcé, entre le Ministère de la Santé et les PNFP. Le projet appuie tant les aspects fonctionnels, que financiers et en ressources humaines nécessaires au bon fonctionnement du système de santé ougandais. L’appui aux PNFP passera par l’élaboration d’un mécanisme de financement basé sur les résultats (RBF) et son application dans deux zones de concentration géographique belges, soit Ruwenzori et West Nile.","La santé a été retenue comme un des deux secteurs de concentrationau Bénin pour le PIC 2013-2017.

Total budget is 21 MEUR, to which 34 MEUR are allocated to the sector through sectoral budget support.","Suite à la Commission mixte du 10.12.2013 et la signature du PC 2014-2017, une enveloppe de 11.000.000 EUR a été réservée à un Programme d'appui au secteur de la gestion intégrée des déchets (ménagers + spéciaux) en agissant essentiellement par un appui aux politiques et stratégies nationales et un renforcement institutionnel des organisations et agences en charge de cette matière, l'échange d'expertise et la mise en réseau et le développement de partenariats internationaux.Seront au coeur de l'intervention: la réduction des déchets, la valorisation, le recyclage et la lutte contre toute forme de pollution.Intervenants: le MREE (Ministère des Ressources en Eau et Environnement), l'AND (Agence nationale des déchets), les Wilayas pilotes, les Communes et les EPICs (Etablissements publics à caractère industriel et commercial), le Ministère de la Santé publique et de la Réforme hospitalière, les groupes professionnels impliqués dans le passsage à l'activité formelle des recycleurs, la société civile, les sociétés industrielles, les organismes et sociétés belges susceptibles d'intervention","La Belgique possède une grande expérience dans le secteur de la Santé au Burundi. Elle y est active depuis plusieurs années, dans différents domaines. Ces dernières années, elle met en œuvre le Programme PAISS « Programme d’Appui Institutionnel au Secteur de la Santé », qui s’articulent autour de différents volets. Chacun de ces volets s’ancre dans une Direction du Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Lutte contre le Sida. Les volets 1, 2 et 3 représentent un budget de 18 millions d’euros (dont 1 million de contribution suisse). Le volet 1 concerne l’Appui à la gouvernance au niveau central. Le volet 2 concerne l’Appui à la gouvernance sanitaire périphérique. Le volet 3 concerne l’Appui au développement des Ressources Humaines. Ces interventions ont débuté en 2011 et l’exécution se termine en mars 2015. Le volet 4 concerne l’Appui au Système National d’Information Sanitaire et a débuté en 2012. Le volet 5 mettra l’accent sur la durabilité en s’axant sur le renforcement des capacités du Ministère pour la maintenance et la construction.L'interventiont, constitué de reliquats,i vise à consolider les acquis des volets 1, 2 et 3. La DGD a demandé de mettre l’accent sur l’aspect consolidation plutôt que transition, afin d’assurer un minimum d’autonomie des acteurs burundais sur base des trois volets. L’intervention va donc, sous les axes des trois précédents volets, renforcer la consolidation des acquis, notamment au travers de la capitalisation et de la diffusion des bonnes pratiques et stratégies qui ont été développées dans les années précédentes.",null,null,"Considering the positive trend in the Health sector, Belgium has decided to extend its support to Rwanda  (ICP 2011-2014). Health Sector budget support is currently implemented beside project/programme approach. 32 MEUR were planned under BS, where 23 MEUR have been paid so far (30/10/2015) (5 MEUR (JHSS II bis)+ 9 MEUR (JHSS III a) + 9 MEUR (1rst instalment - JHSS III b))","This one-year bridge project seeks to extend the current phase of programme work on decent housing and climate change with CAFOD partners MDF and APOIO, continuing work on programmatic priority areas, incorporating a renewed focus on land tenure and use advocacy and dissemination of the pilot project on sustainable housing and urbanisation developed in 2015. This project will also incorporate lessons and recommendations from the 2013-2015 EU project external evaluation and findings, consolidating existing results in the current political and economic context and developing new areas of work to guide the next urban programme priorities from 2017 onwards. Using their past experience, participatory approaches and successful methodology of popular education, community organisation, women's participation and advocacy work, local partners APOIO and MDF will seek to influence the implementation and coordination of housing, climate change other and pro-poor urban policies.In spite of being one of the most affluent regions in Brazil, São Paulo has seen an increase in pockets of poverty and extreme poverty in the last decade, with many of the region's poorest citizens, around 30% of the population, living in favelas, informal occupations and precarious housing. The dynamic of land valorisation in the region is forcing the poorest population to live in degraded areas far away from jobs, basic services or in watershed areas and areas of environmental risk, vulnerable to flashfloods, landslides and climate impacts, aggravating existing socioeconomic vulnerabilities. The recent water supply crisis faced by São Paulo has impacted disproportionately on the poorest population, who are suffering ongoing water rationing, and higher costs of water and energy bills. Since 2011, São Paulo has seen a growth of 264% in urban occupations as a result of a housing deficit of 230,000 homes and the hike in land and rent prices which make housing unaffordable to the poor. 56% of the population living in these informal settlements lack access to water and sanitation services, which are restricted in areas that have no formal land titles.This project will tackle three inter-related problems to guarantee more effective social inclusion and urbanization: a) the lack of implementation of legal frameworks for land tenure regularization in the cities informal settlements and favelas, to reduce violent evictions, and improve land security and access to public services, such as water, sanitation and housing; b) The need for housing and social inclusion urban policies to take into account environmental factors and climate change adaptation and vice versa; c) building the awareness and capacity of women and men in the favelas, informal settlements and occupations and the housing movement leaders to know their rights and influence the above policies.","Analyse qui a abouti au problème central :La Stratégie de Renforcement du Système de Santé (SRSS) a comme maillon essentiel la présence d’une Division Provinciale de la Santé forte et capable de mener à bien les réformes en cours du système de santé en RDC.La CTB, depuis plusieurs années, a développé un fort et utile appui au Niveau Intermédiaire (NI), avec des acquis très importants. Cependant, l’arrêt temporaire de ses activités dans le secteur de la santé, prévu, au minimum, entre janvier 2015 et le mi 2016, met en grand péril et fragilise tout le processus de la réforme aux NI et périphérique (Zones de Santé).En dehors de l’encadrement technique , il y a un problème récurrent d’accès en eau potable qui se pose avec acuité dans certaines aires de santé de ces zones d’intervention. C’est ainsi que  la province de  Bandundu est parmi les provinces avec le plus faible accès à l'eau potable: uniquement  9 % des habitants de la province congolaise de Bandundu ont accès à une eau potable salubre. La mauvaise qualité de l'eau cause beaucoup de maladies. Même si le paludisme est la maladie la plus propagée et reste, avec un taux de plus de 50 % la première cause de décès, plus de 60 % de toutes les maladies sont pourtant liées directement ou indirectement à la mauvaise qualité de l'eau potable.Quant à la province de l’Équateur, elle ne fait guère meilleure figure. Le milieu rural est le plus touché par la pauvreté (77%). Mais malgré les efforts consentis par différents organes de coopération, 62% de la population rurale et 38% de la population urbaine n’ont toujours pas accès à l’eau potable.C’est dans ce cadre que s’inscrit ce projet « synergie », qui vise à apporter un appui  aux DPS en matière d’encadrement technique  et également aux structures de santé réhabilitées ou construites par la CTB en matière de fourniture d’eau potable par forage manuel, en attendant la reprise de la coopération belge directe dans le secteur de la santé. Cet appui apporté par Memisa sera complémentaire et synergique à ceux qui devront être donnés par d’autres partenaires du secteur de la santé.","L’intervention (programme) AMSANA est une intervention multi-acteurs mobilisant 5 organisations partenaires (Louvain Coopération, IIes de Paix, Protos, Croix-Rouge de Belgique et la Coopération Technique Belge) autour d’un objectif commun de réduction de l’insécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle. Les stratégies de lutte contre l’insécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle dans la zone d’intervention identifiées par l’analyse contextuelle constituent les axes principaux autour desquelles s’articulent les actions des organisations partenaires et forment les résultats du cadre logique de l’intervention.

issue of social cohesion between displaced, demobilized, returnees and residents in the hills around Bujumbura in Burundi. These groups were separated during the war that Burundi faced during 1993 and were people were killed on ethnic basis. The 2015 recent elections were held in a tense environment and regional and African initiatives are underway to require dialogue between those in power and the other major players in the Burundi crisis to prevent the country from slipping further into the war. Through proposed project’ activities, people living in IDP camps, returnees, demobilized and residents will have a framework of encounter and exchange in order to dispel mistrust. Each week, these people will hold meetings where they will discuss peace and coexistence. Project plans to implement 27 SILCs (Saving and Internal Lending Communities) consisting of 20 people each living together in the hills. CDJP will not fund the SILCs’ capital start up. The initial capital will be granted by contributions from SILCs members. The project is planning to grant small premiums for field officers who will be responsible for the supervision of these SILCS. One Internal Micro credit expert will support SILCs management. SILCs members   will set a credit union that will be fuelled by contributions from members. After making contributions, they will proceed to the distribution of small credits to those who need them at an agreed interest rate in the group. SILC’s meeting planned will also be an opportunity to discuss the challenges of cohabitation in the hills and therefore an opportunity to resolve disputes. Project aims to focus on these common economic interests for beneficiaries that will promote collaboration, understanding, peaceful coexistence and even reconciliation.By implementing this current project, changes that CDJP Bujumbura intends to contribute to are :- The conflicts are managed and processed peacefully within beneficiaries- The social and political injustices are reduced in communities targeted- Solidarity is consolidated between the war displaced, demobilized, repatriated and hills residents around Bujumbura- To gradually increase economic independence of SILCs members that will allow them to resist to political manipulation- Project’s beneficiaries behaviours and attitudes changes that are reflected in their living environment by their support to the reconciliation and peaceful coexistence among them- Income levels and living conditions of displaced people, demobilized, residents and returnees is improved and thus they can withstand the various political manipulation.The activities under this project will be executed in three parishes (Rushubi, Munanira and Kivoga) in the Archdiocese of Bujumbura.","to engage the Pakistani diaspora as champions of

The challenge is how to address the problem. This project aims to improve the poor quality of maternal and adolescent health care services to find a lasting solution to the unnecessary deaths.Maternal and adolescent healthAccording to the latest World Health Organization and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) reports, both countries have made insufficient progress toward meeting maternal mortality reduction targets. In Niger, 553 women die for every 100,000 live births, while the figure in Benin is 405. Niger also has the world's highest rate of adolescent pregnancy with 51% of women aged 20 to 24 giving birth before age 18.Low-cost reforms for improved resultsLaboratoire d'e¿tudes et de recherche sur les dynamiques sociales et le de¿veloppement local (LASDEL), an experienced research organization based in both countries, will lead the project. Researchers will draw lessons from 20 years of reform efforts and from users'and health workers'experiences at the local level.LASDEL will also identify health system innovators to implement and test low-cost and locally developed reforms, with the goal of improving the quality of maternal and adolescent health services. Evidence shows, for example, how heads of local facilities have influenced their colleagues'positive behaviour changes without waiting for internationally driven performance management incentives.Local leaders and innovatorsThe project will strengthen capacity and leadership among innovators and young researchers to continue to advocate for reforms and implement them. LASDEL will build on its years of experience in research and policy engagement to strengthen its own institutional capacity. It aims to become a centre of research excellence to improve public services in Niger, Benin, and across the sub-region.The timing for this research is right, given the opportunity to work with the Niger and Benin governments as they plan to address the Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, the Government of Niger is keen to support this initiative. It has launched a program to address bottlenecks and transform dysfunctional systems to improve service delivery. It will work closely with LASDEL during implementation.","Overall objective is to reduce tensions mounting around the delivery of basic health services and promote social cohesion in particular within poor Lebanese communities hosting large numbers of Syrian refugees.","The programme aims to reduce tension and promote social cohesion in particular within poor Lebanese communities hosting large numbers of Syrian refugees.

This project will address the risk through a solution that aims to encourage healthier beverage choices among consumers.High sugar content labellingOverconsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is linked to weight gain, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and tooth decay. To address the problem, the Guatemalan National Commission of Non-Communicable Diseases issued a strategy and action plan (2015-19) focused on health promotion, regulation, and surveillance. One of the plan's objectives is to implement a front-of-package label on energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages to encourage healthy choices.There is a problem, however. While consumers have access to nutrition labels on their foods and beverages, most do not understand them.New labels for sugar-sweetened beveragesThis research will target approximately 2,000 adolescents and their female caregivers from private and public schools in Guatemala. A marketing company will prepare a series of evidence-based, culturally appropriate labels for sugar-sweetened beverages.Researchers will measure and compare the influence of each designed label on each target group's perceptions of sugar-sweetened beverages, along with their purchase intentions. The data will be shared with Ministry of Health officials and private enterprises to determine the feasibility of implementing new, effective front-of-package labels on sugar-sweetened beverages.The knowledge from this project will inform policymakers and health care advocates on the labelling system that would be most likely to encourage healthier beverage choices. It might also influence intervention efforts for product labelling throughout Central America.The research is particularly relevant to women who are from low socio-economic households, as they are the most health and educationally disadvantaged in Guatemala.","In the Philippines, an estimated 14 percent of school children experience severe malnutrition. Schools provide strategic, targeted pathways for delivering nutrition to children and, indirectly, to their families and communities. A three-year research project (2012 to 2015) developed and tested a school-based integrated nutrition model involving bio-intensive gardening, supplementary feeding and nutrition education in Cavite province of the Philippines. Results showed that supplementary feeding of malnourished school children using iron-fortified rice and indigenous vegetables from school gardens significantly improved their nutritional status. Enhanced knowledge, attitudes, and practices on gardening and nutrition were also observed among parents.Phase 2 of this project will fine-tune methods to operationalize the integrated model and test strategies for scaling it up in 58 schools in Cavite province. Two different methods for scaling up will be tested. The first will involve working with public elementary schools at a sub-national level while the second will be directed at national agencies, policymakers, and media. Production of teaching resources, learning, and information exchange within the school system and wide dissemination of research results throughout the region will help develop capacity within institutions. To ensure sustainability of the integrated nutrition model, the project will explore how local government and the private sector can support school nutrition.The 28-month project is led by the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction in collaboration with the Food and Nutrition Research Institute and the Department of Education. It will benefit an estimated 93,000 children from 546 schools.","This innovative project will address the problem of rising obesity and overweight rates in Ecuador through a civil society-led marketing campaign on responsible food consumption. The campaign will help improve food policy interventions, convince people to adopt healthy and sustainable diets, and prevent food-related chronic illness.Heavy health burdenOverweight and obesity rates have been steadily rising across Ecuador over the last decades. The country has had no success in curbing the increase or preventing associated non-communicable diseases. Faced with the growing health burden, the national government is promoting programs that target individual consumers and environmental determinants. Initiatives include improving processed food labelling, and promoting fresh foods and traditional Andean diets.Building on a food movementThis project will build on Ecuador's grassroots food movement known as Colectivo Nacional Agroecologico. It offers an alternative, complementary, and organized approach focused on-sustainable agro-ecology-food sovereignty-economic solidarityMore than 250 consumer and producer organizations from across the country are involved. The group aims to influence food purchasing, procurement, and more responsible food consumption.Moving the masses to healthThey embarked on an ambitious 250 Thousand Families campaign to mobilize the'consumer-citizen'with the aim of getting 5% of the country's population to invest half of their existing household food budgets in healthier, more equitable, and sustainable food practices and diets. If successful, the campaign could re-direct up to CA$850 million per year toward the purchase of healthier foods. This would trigger changes in food production, retail, and marketing.Impact and opportunitiesThis project will allow a consortium of research organizations from Ecuador and Canada to assess and document the actual and potential impact of the social marketing campaign. The research seeks to answer how civil society-led agrifood marketing campaigns can complement government policies and programs, and engage citizens in preventing food-related chronic diseases.","Argentina is one of the world's highest consumers of sugar-sweetened beverages (predominantly sodas). This project will address the problem, and the rapidly increasing rates of obesity and diabetes among youth and adults, through evidence that supports policy development.Improved policies, better healthArgentina has begun to implement important policies to reduce the country's non-communicable disease burden, including policies for tobacco control and reduced salt and trans-fatty acids. There is now a growing regional public health interest in regulating sugar-sweetened beverages to prevent disease. As awareness of the health impacts of soda consumption grows, government and civil society stakeholders are interested in policy options to decrease consumption.Taxing soda consumptionThis project aims to generate evidence to inform this policy development. It will:-describe the market process from production to distribution and consumption-explore the regulatory and legal framework-examine feasibility challenges and the potential impact of tax increases on soda consumption-explore mechanisms that will enable these taxes to increaseResearchers will assess the magnitude of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with consuming sugar-sweetened drinks. They will model the health and health-cost benefits of reduced soda intake associated with price increases over the next decade. The predicted global increase of non-communicable diseases will disproportionally affect women and poor people, so the project's methods will analyze policy impacts by gender and socio-economic status.The research team is composed of public health experts, physicians, lawyers, sociologists, and economists. It also includes high-level staff from the Ministry of Health.The project team will share the results through scientific papers in open access journals, policy briefs, and media releases.","This research will provide evidence to enhance understanding of how geo-referenced health facility information can inform maternal and child health service planning and decision-making in Bangladesh. Geo-referenced data associates information with a physical space or location. This information can improve data synthesis and feed into health planning by decision-makers, including health ministries.Limited information for health planningNational health management information systems in lower- and middle-income countries are generally limited to information on public sector health services, yet private health services account for the majority of service provision. These systems rarely have basic information, such as health facility location, on private providers in South Asia. This knowledge is important for health planning.Efforts aligned with new government health systemThe Urban Health Group at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Bangladesh will carry out the research. The group has developed a geo-referenced information platform for urban services to complement the existing health management information system. Known as the Urban Health Atlas, it facilitates data synthesis and communication to support health planning.At the same time, the Bangladesh Directorate General of Health Services is implementing District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS 2) in line with the government's commitment to a digital Bangladesh. The system is based on information on public health facilities, which are mostly located in rural areas. With the exception of large public hospitals and some non-governmental organizations, there is no centralized data for private health facilities offering the majority of services in urban areas. The Urban Health Atlas fills this important gap.Information in the hands of decision-makersThis study will document how to make geo-referenced health facility information more accessible and useful to heath planners and decision-makers. It will identify the processes involved in generating policy uptake.The project will also use best practices to develop skills and knowledge to promote the use of health information in planning maternal and child health services. The research team will:-assess information needs-conduct a task review analysis of information users-map stakeholders-estimate costThe project will provide valuable guidance to other developing countries on how to generate user buy-in and policy uptake to introduce, scale up, and sustain maternal and child health related technologies in national health information systems.","Quality improvement for burn services is a proven tool for reducing death and disability from burns, especially amongst young women and children. While primary prevention is crucial, secondary and tertiary prevention - reducing the severity of injuries and decreasing the frequency and severity of disability after an injury respectively - are also important strategies in reducing the burden of mortality and morbidity. The WHO estimates that the provision of adequate burn care in LMICs could reduce the overall mortality rate from burns by 30%. By working with 14 government and NGO burn services in Bangladesh and Nepal, Interburns will be reaching an annual patient population of approximately 35,000 patients, including 6,000 inpatients (typically with major, severe or complex burns that cause serious disability or death) and 29,000 outpatients (with smaller burns that can still result in burn contractures and cause significant disability if improperly treated). The great majority of these patients are among the poorest members of society who cannot afford private health care. Burn injuries and the high cost of treatment have a devastating impact on already impoverished families and communities. It is widely recognised in the international burn community that hospital admissions only represent the‘top of the pyramid’and a huge burden of burn injuries never reach health services. Community-level interventions including research, awareness-raising and primary prevention programmes are absolutely vital in reducing death and disability from burns. This programme will build on the foundations of GPAF-INN-034 and move beyond the service focus of that project to introduce community-level primary prevention and coordinated national programmes in burn prevention.","IPPF is one of the members of the SRHR consortium, Rutgers is the Lead Party.

This project would therefore compensate for this gap and thereby promote improved financial management, technical and organizational development for these young associations.CAFOD and its partner, Caritas Bukavu, initiated a programme to support the socio economic reinsertion of these former child soldier and ex combatants in South Kivu in April 2013 with co-funding from Caritas Australia. The programme is multisectoral and giving returning youth an accelerated skills training and livelihoods assistance and preventing many from joining rebel groups. During the first year of implementation the project helped the creation of 10 new associations passing from 22 to 32 associations of ex combattants involved in livelihoods activities.The project aims to strengthen the reintegration of ex-combatants who have returned to their communities, but who are faced with problems of survival. Accustomed to living on their meagre pay under the flag and rapine authorised by their leaders, many are left to themselves since they have exhausted their safety net.Caritas Bukavu would respond to these challenges by strengthening the reintegration of ex-combatants into their communities of life by boosting their initiatives supported. The project's goal is to see the ex-combatants live in harmony within their communities through income derived from agriculture, the exploitation of their mills, etc.The project will contribute to the socio-economic integration of 700 ex combatants by consolidating their 32 economic structure's groups through the SILC approach relying on crafts, Income Generating activities and agriculture in Kabare, Kalehe, Idjui and Walungu territories these constituting the Bukavu Diocese.To achieve this goal the project has been sized to 120,000.00 usd including a co funding of 80,000.00 usd from Caritas Australia.","The need to strengthening local capacities in humanitarian response in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is crucial as local NGOs are usually the first responders in a crisis.

GNP per capita is  US$900 and illiteracy levels are amongst the highest in the country at 67% of the population. People suffer from lack of access to basic health and education services and adequate access to food and housing. Within the indigenous population, about 65% are Catholic, but in a form which includes many elements of Mayan spirituality. In addition, a sector of the population practices Mayan religion, while at the same time participating in the Catholic Church within a context of dialogue, reflection and shared learning.  The parish of Santa Maria Chiquimula has worked to recover and disseminate knowledge of Mayan spirituality, traditions and values as a means towards building a more integrated and inclusive church. Its integrated programme covers 37 communities of the parish, strengthening levels of community organisation and participation, providing increased opportunities for education, employment and income-generation through farming practices and improving the quality of preventive and primary health care.","The purpose of the project is to contribute in reduction of Maternal Mortality, morbidity from unsafe abortion and improve the Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) situation of women and adolescents in the project areas.This project targets to achieve 150500 MR conducted , 12250 patient managed for Complications of unsafe abortion , 322,550 FP methods distributed during Post MR counseling, 80500 individual received Reproductive Health service at school, community and garments, Institutionalized and sustainable attention at the national level to ensure access to safe abortion and family planning.This will be achieved by ensuring that poor and marginalized women and adolescents have access to unsafe abortion and can access modern Family Planning (FP) methods; Providing comprehensive MR and PAC training to health service providers, Raising Awareness and Creation of Demand on SRHR issues and Supporting changes to the regulatory and/ or policy environments for abortion services.SRHR project will help Bangladesh to achieve MDG 5 by increasing family planning use and reducing maternal mortality in Bangladesh.","Contribución al Fondo de Población de las Naciones Unidas (FNUAP)","IFFIM- Facilidad Financiera Internacional para la Inmunización (GAVI)","Pingst FFS/PMU, Pentecostal Alliance, phase out support as framework organiastion.

In Kisauni Sub County, the project will be implemented in six sub locations  namely Junda, Kisauni, Magogoni, Kongowea, Bamburi and Maweni; while in Lungalunga  Sub county  it will be  in seven sub locations ; Vanga, Jego, Sega,  Kiwegu, Kasemeni, Kilimangodo and Mwena. The proposed IFS programme is targeting to reach a total of 1,500 direct beneficiaries (750 males and 750 females) and 6,000  indirect beneficiaries (2250 males and 3750 females).  Each direct beneficiary will reach out to 5 indirect beneficiaries in Kisauni and 3 indirect beneficiaries in Lungalunga.The programme will target the food poor, who are among vulnerable House Holds (HHs) such as People living with and affected by HIV, Orphan and Vulnerable Children (OVC), Child headed HH, Female HH, People with Disabilities (PWD), elderly persons, Drug users, sex workers, HHs that did not cultivate in the last 2 seasons, livestock keepers, agro pastoralist farmers, unskilled youth out of school, youth in school (clubs in school) and terminally ill people.The overall goal of CAM IFSP is to promote food security for 250 and 1500 food poor beneficiaries (households and individual) through improved food security, income levels and health status in Kisauni and Lunga lunga programme areas by March 2018.  This programme seeks to address some factors that contribute to food and income insecurity among the targeted HHs through an integrated approach focusing on livestock and crop production, HIV and AIDs prevention as well as income generating activities. Training in the proposed programme will mainly be done through Community Resource Persons (CRP), Field Agents (FAs) and Community Health Workers (CHWs).A Participatory Community Needs assessment was conducted in, 2013 through CAM and CAFOD partnership to inform the project design.  This was done in order to gather in-depth information on the causes of food insecurity, aimed at identifying and evaluating factors contributing to food insecurity and determining other integrated needs of the communities living within Lunga lunga and Kisauni sub counties. According to the findings, key factors contributing to food insecurity identified were: prolonged drought, erratic rainfall, poor methods of farming, community factors contributing to HIV infection (weddings, seasonal dances) and low household income.This IFS programme will work with individuals and groups within target communities to increase crop and livestock production levels through sustainable agriculture principles and practices as a strategy. Various approaches shall be used to achieve this such as Farmers Field schools (demonstration farms), farmers open days, exchange visits, field based trainings and institutional workshops. On HIV and AIDs, formation of community units, open community HIV sensitization meetings, HIV stakeholders meetings.  In order to improve HHs income levels, training on income generation shall be carried out through field agents.The three year programme will be implemented over a period of 36 months commencing May 2015 to April 2018.  The total planned budget for this project is £210,000 with annual disbursements of £70,000 to the partner to support project activities","CAFOD has partnered with bet365 foundation to scale up stigma reduction responses in its HIV programmes in Uganda.  This follows a pilot that was first tried in Ethiopia, Zambia and Mombasa, Kenya over a period of three years.  The project titled evidence responsive HIV stigma reduction project – Uganda is seeking to promote HIV prevention and treatment services by including stigma reduction in the responses.  The project successfully started in November 2014 and will run over a period of one year to close in October 2015Following successful grant processing and transfer to the partner it was observed that the project budget accrued a surplus of £7,057.48 which mainly resulted from favourable exchange rate gains.  It has been agreed after discussions with the two partners, CAFOD project and funding teams and the donor to use this surplus to produce some additional educational/information materials for the communities.  Initially this need was identified as a key project closure activity but not budgeted for.Over the implementation period therefore, partner staff will progressively capture and document unique stigma and discrimination experiences from respondents and good response practices from other change agents including faith leaders.  The unique stories and practices will then be followed up later in the year with an overall production of educational materials to inform transformation realised in the lives of the primary stakeholders of this project. The materials will be in the form of a ‘light read’ booklet on the best practices of this project and an audio visual documentary covering the role of faith leaders in stigma reduction.  Target audiences of these educational materials will include project beneficiaries, supporters of this work and collaborators as a way of showcasing the project impact on target communities.  It is also anticipated that these materials will promote visibility of this project and contribute to HIV stigma advocacy initiatives by all project stakeholders","This project continues the work of St Francis Community Development Programme (FRACODEP) in contributing to the reduction of HIV transmission and in mitigating the impact of HIV and AIDS among youths, PLHIV and the general community in Seme sub-county in the Archdiocese of Kisumu.

The project will implement the following activities in addressing the critical challenges the communities are encountering:- Village savings and loan schemes (VSL)- Palliative care training- Psychosocial training- Technical support of all structures involved in the implementation of the programme remains a critical component of the programme and this requires a motor vehicle, should resources be made available.","The Archdiocese of Lilongwe is responding to the devastating impact of HIV and AIDS in the rural communities of Malawi in Lilongwe Districts. Accessing HIV testing and Counselling and anti retroviral treatment is a challenge throughout Malawi and in Lilongwe it very difficult especially for pregnant women and the sick who are unable to travel long distances to the available health facilities.The Archdiocese has been working in the communities to provide palliative care and support to families and individuals most affected and living with HIV and AIDS. In addition the available rural  health facilities are under staffed and under resourced forcing most patients to be attended to in the home and in their communities. It is because of the limited number of nurses that has led to community led home based care and support.Fuelling the further spread of the pandemic are a number of challenges inherent within the communities in Malawi, such as:poverty and the hardest hit are women and children who in the end make them selves vulnerable through engaging in sex workSexual cultural and religious practices such as the initiation rituals often associated with coming of age, or upon the death of a spouse and these rituals expose women and girls at most and spread to the bigger community.Stigma and discrimination continues to suppress openness about HIV and AIDS resulting in late treatment care and support as well as defaulting on treatmentThis project aims at equipping a total of 197 volunteers with sound knowledge and skills in basic nursing at village and community level and how to organise the village savings and loans schemes, and how to provide sensitive and culturally appropriate psychosocial support an palliative care.

These cholera cases have been on an increase since November 2014 with over 2000 patients treated and more than 50 dying from the disease. There has been challenges in collecting information on these cases hence an underestimation due to unavailability of standardised surveillance system in the country. More than 30 per cent of the districts in the country are reported to have been affected with Cholera and at this time the epidemic has spread across all the regions of the country.The outbreak could probably have risen due to the lack of safe drinking water and inadequacy of sanitation and hygiene. Management of cholera suspects was observed to be substandard by Health workers at both Diocesan as well as Government Health facilities where patients were admitted. Availability of resources to manage the suspected cases has proved a challenge in both Diocesan and Government facilities. Further to this, there has been slow response at District level in sensitisation of communities and alerting the Health workers on prevention and management of cholera respectively.Cholera is preventable by ensuring access to safe water and appropriate sanitation measures. Death from cholera can be prevented through quick access to standardised treatment regimes in health facilities, something which this project seeks to address in Zomba diocese. The response covers needs in the area of surveillance and response, water and sanitation, infection control, social mobilisation and logistics. Sensitising Health workers in handling cases of cholera and alerting the community on hygiene and sanitation, as well as improving water safety will reduce morbidity and mortality.This will be achieved through;- Training of Village Health Committees (VHC)- Conducting of door to door awareness campaigns- Sensitising food vendors in markets on hygiene; and production of banners and t-shirts, hygiene film shows and dramas.- Provision of High Test Hypochlorite (HTH)- Production and broadcasting of radio programmes.- Training of 20 Clinicians, 26 Nurses, 16 Lab Technicians, 4 Pharmacy Assistants and 4 Environmental Health Officers in Cholera management- Procurement and provision of protective wear and medical utilities i.e. Chlorine,Gloves, Cannulas, Intravenous fluids- Training of 552 support staff HSA’s and patient attendants in Cholera prevention and hygiene","Título completo del proyecto: EDUCACION PARA LA SALUD :: FORMACION DE AGENTES DE SALUD PARA LA PREVENCION DE LA ENFERMEDAD Y PARTERAS TRADICIONALES PARA EL CONTROL DEL EMBARAZO Y ASISTENCIA AL PARTO (8 AGENTES DE SALUD Y 4 PARTERAS)LOS BENEFICIARIOS SERIAN 3000 PERSONAS QUE SERIAN ATENDIDOS POR LOS AGENTES DE SALUD Y LAS PARTERAS.","Título completo del proyecto: Construcción pabellón pediatrico Hospital Nossa Senhora da Paz.

This extreme level of poverty is caused by a number of interlinked factors such as geography, climate and food insecurity. More than 60 per cent of the population of Niger live below the poverty line and are unable to meet their most basic needs including food, water, clothing, access to education and healthcare.The remote area of Ngoula, where this project is based, is situated 130kms from the city of Niamey, in the south west of Niger. Roads are very poor and disappear during the rainy season. The only long established items of infrastructure are a primary school, a secondary school and boreholes for drinking water built by the Catholic Church. At the request of the community, a health centre was also constructed in 2013, with 10 beds for inpatients. The centre has been providing good services to the community for the last two years, including support to malnourished children, vaccinations and maternity care. It was agreed that the government of Niger would take over management of the Health Centre in 2015. However, this agreement has not been fulfilled and the Health Centre requires urgent support. Over 16,000 people live in Ngoula and the nearest hospital is 80kms away. Ngoula Health Centre is a vital lifeline for rural communities. In 2015, a total of 225 babies were born in the Health Centre. Without these facilities, the babies would have been born at home and if complications had arisen, their mothers would have had no access to medical support. The Health Centre also provides a range of care for those with malaria, respiratory infections and skin diseases, for example. The goal of this project is to improve health services for 12,600 patients at Ngoula Health Centre. Our partner CADEV Niamey will focus on reaching malnourished children between 0 and 5 years of age, as well as pregnant and breast-feeding mothers.","Global acute malnutrition remains rampant in Niger especially during the lean period when the number of the affected children, pregnant and lactating mother rise. In 2015 the rate of global acute malnutrition was o 15% which is equivalent to WHO’s emergency threshold. The Tillabéry region (where Tera Health District is situated) is not an exception with 13.1% of GAM and 2.5% of SAM in 2015.  The 2016 nutritional  has shown signifiquant improvement in regard to the previous year as follow: In rural area, the rate of global acute malnutrition is 9.4%, the rate of acute severe malnutrition 1.6%  and the rate of acute moderate malnutrition is of 7.8%. The nutrition status of children in Niger is closely linked to the level of food access and availability in the country. For those living in rural areas such as those targeted by this project this is usually is challenge especially when the harvest is not sufficient enough to cover the needs of the families. Also coupled to the lack of food is poor hygiene and poor feeding practices.  Despite the positive changes the District of Tera is facing insecurity problems witch make some part of the area to be under state of emergency. The will make the situation more worse with significant impact on the health and nutrition status of the community menbers especialy under five children and pregnant and lactating women.  This is the reason why CADEV has submitted this project to CAFOD to help reduce the rate of malnutrition in the health areas of Kokoru  and Bankilare.  It is important to notify that the previous project was implemented in Diagorou, Taka, Bouppo, Bangare, Gabitane, Tillim, Tegueye, Wanzerbe, Yatakala, Bellekoira, Wezabangou. these are more affected by the state emergency this make the accessibility more difficult and risky. CADEV Niger requested the fund to implement the project in Bankilare et Kokorou. Activities will be centres towards:  awareness raising sessions, promoting essentials  family practices , culinary demonstrations, and early detection of malnutrition through screening, supporting health centres with drugs and hygiene kits and food stuff for accompanier of malnourish children hospitalised in Tera Hospital. In all CADEV will reach out to 16351 children, 8502 pregnant and lactating mothers, 10 health workers and 192 community volunteers people.CAFOD has been providing support to fight malnutrition and save the lives of many children and women.","Accountability Alert Sierra Leone is a CAFOD implementing partner operating in Bombali District, Northern Sierra Lone, working with rural communities to improve women’s access to land. Since the outbreak of Ebola in Sierra Leone several organisations have been engaged on sensitization and awareness raising campaign on the prevention and control of the spread of Ebola in various communities. Unfortunately, message dissemination is through radio or television and communities where AASL operations are far in the interior of the Northern province of the country and cannot access TV signals and even where they are broadcast over the Radio, most if not all, are extremely poor to access radio sets to listen to these messages. Therefore, AASL with funding from CAFOD is targeting these communities, where traditional burial, mistrust and denial of Ebola is pervasive. The project strategy is to train chiefdom authorities (20 women and 10 men), 60 women leaders and 45 men leaders and, youth (25 females and 20 males) and 18 traditional healers (10 females and 8 males) on EVD transmission and prevention measures, carry out Focus Group Discussions with Chiefdom authorities, (women, men and youths) to assess the level of knowledge of the community about the disease and consequently help shape the sensitization messages and content of trainings.","CAFOD in partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Makeni (Caritas Makeni) is implementing a social mobilisation project in the Diocese of Makeni aimed at improving health and well being of vulnerable populations in Northern Sierra Leone. To stop the spread of the disease in the affected districts of Bombali, Port Loko, Kambia, Tonkolili and Koinadugu effective community-based social mobilisation on prevention measures is essential. Therefore the project strategy  includes; selection of 100 community advocate (CA) from the Catholic Parishes in the targeted area and train them for two day on prevention measure of EVD, 2) work closely with Ministry of Health and Sanitation, UNICEF, MSF and WHO to review and update current IEC material on Ebola, and 3) conducting 10 consecutive sensitizations during Sunday masses.","The Sierra Leone Ministry of Health reported 5,524 confirmed cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone as of 25th November 2014, although the number of unreported cases is thought to be much higher.  The number of confirmed Ebola fatalities is 1,397, giving an average death rate of 25 percent. Cases have been reported in all 14 districts making this a national emergency.  Currently the most affected districts are Moyamba, Bombali, Tonkolili and Port Loko which are all now under quarantine, restricting travel to and from these areas.  Over half of the country’s 6.3million people live in the quarantined districts. As a result of living in quarantine, many families lack adequate food stocks and NFIs and food security is becoming a serious issue in many areas. A recent (November 2014) WFP report found that people living in the districts of Kailahun and Kenema are using severe food coping strategies more frequently, compared to people in other areas of the country. These are the areas where the most EVD cases have been reported since the start of the outbreak . Many international actors’ focus is on contract tracing, safe and dignified burial and treatment centres. Quarantined households are often not supported by the wider community in any sense- psychologically, emotionally or materially. It is likely that if unaddressed this stigma will continue to exist after the crisis, and force families into social isolation and deeper poverty. Finally, women and girls suffer disproportionately greater impacts in health given a lack of access to information through fewer opportunities for education, as well as their role as care givers and tenders to the sick and dying.  There is a need for humanitarian interventions to protect these vulnerable groups. CAFOD’s partner Trocaire  has conducted a number of group discussions and interviews with local authorities, community based organizations such as women’s groups and key stakeholders in the Ebola response (eg. Ministry of Health, NERC, INGOs, UN agencies and donors) which informed the development of this proposal. Trocaire’s activities will focus particularly on women, adolescent girls and children as prevalent gender norms and inequalities in society increase their risk of infection and abuse and limit their access to health care, protection and food security which are exacerbated by the current Ebola crisis. Meetings with women’s groups have particularly helped form their response. The District Ebola Response Centre in coordination with District Health Management Team will provide the names and locations of quarantined households and assign these to development partners for support on a daily basis. Clear procedures as outlined in the Government SOP will be followed. This also means respecting assigned roles and responsibilities. Therefore this project will complement support provided by other agencies and will work with communities to identify gaps and shortcomings. The packages and psycho social support will take account of the specific needs of children, adolescents and women, for example including sanitary pads for women and toys for children. Trócaire and partners will coordinate at the national level with the WFP and with the Food and Nutrition Directorate of the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS). At the district level coordination will be maintained with the District Ebola Response Coordinator and with the DHMT to organize the distribution of packages to quarantine households without duplication. Through this coordination mechanism Trocaire have coordinated with Plan, Welt HungerHilfe (WHH), WFP, UNICEF and the DHMT to ensure that distribution packages are standardised and that programme activities positively complement the activities of other actors.  In addition the social mobilization component of the project includes strategies which are suitable for illiterate people by conducting community-led face to face campaigns and using highly visual IEC materials.","This project aims to further assist in the response to the Ebola emergency in Sierra Leone.The recent Sierra Leone Ebola KAP (knowledge, attitude and practice) Survey Report indicates that: “awareness of Ebola is high, denial is low, but there are serious misconceptions, and comprehensive knowledge on EVD is low, and very high stigma and discrimination toward EVD victims persists.”  The survey concludes that more work is needed on the social mobilization pillar, as there are still many people who continue to touch the dead bodies of their relatives, or look after sick people, or hide them at home.The project is aimed to establish and support village Ebola teams (VETs) to monitor and reinforce behavioural change from house to house within village communities in the Freetown Rural settlements in the Dioceses of Freetown, as it remains one of the hot sport districts with new infection EVD cases in Sierra Leone.","According to the WHO (16/03/2015) the outbreak of Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever in West Africa has recorded more than 24,000 confirmed and suspected cases to date, across West Africa including 10,144 deaths. 48% of all cases have occurred in Sierra Leone , the country hardest hit by the outbreak, but the true impact is far greater. The ACAPs Ebola situation update (09-16 March) demonstrates this greater impact on food security, nutrition, child protection and spread of disease.The negative impact of EVD on the communities continues, In addition, schools were closed since July 2014 as many were transformed into Community Care Centres (CCC) and even though these have been re-open there are issues with parents allowing their children to attend school.  The poorest and most vulnerable members of the communities, including older people, people with disabilities, children, young girls and women, have been hit the hardest. For example, older men and women due to their traditional caring roles in the community; people with disabilities due to restricted mobility, loss of sight; young girls who have not been at school have been at risk of becoming pregnant and have heightened protection issues due to lack of schooling over long periods.CAFODs work on the ground has identified that orphans and widows, carers, often older aged women and young children as other specific vulnerable groups, especially in households where both parents, including the bread winner, has died due to EVD and grandparents or adolescent siblings have assumed a carers role.The project seek to achieve the following;a) 1,325 vulnerable Ebola affected  individuals (focus on women and girls) demonstrate improved livelihoods and food security by end of month 12;b) By month 12 at least 2,250 vulnerable persons affected by EVD demonstrate improved wellbeing as a result of psychosocial support provided across 2 districts;c) At least 350 vulnerable children are reunited with family members by month 12 as a result of improved protection services being provided across two districts;d) At least 1,200 girls and boys return to school and their education is resumed by month 6, as a result of providing basic school support/equipment and materials in two districts;e) project partners demonstrate strengthened capacity to ensure improved coordination, accountability and that compliance to international standards are met.","This project aims to continue to assist with the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.The outbreak of Ebola in Sierra Leone started on the 25th May 2014, from a single case in the Eastern District of Kailahun. On 30th. November 2014, we had a cumulative caseload of 5,712 infections, within a period of five months.Many NGOs continue to implement an excellent behaviour change campaign. Traditional and religious leaders have played their own part, but Ebola Virus Disease continues to ravage the entire country with unrelenting spikes in new cases just as we approach December when everyone expected a downward curve, which is particularly worrying. The persistently bleak daily updates only depict a depressing, shocking trajectory, showing that we have an uphill battle to find lasting solution to the serious humanitarian crisis as it unfolds in Sierra Leone.  This project is aimed at supporting the Diocesan Caritas through the National Caritas to address this emergency.","Whilst the number of confirmed cases of EVD in Sierra Leone is considerably lower than peak level, a small number of cases continue to prevail in the Northern districts of the country (most notably Kambia).In June 2015, the Government of Sierra Leone introduced Operation Northern Push which focusses national efforts on Kambia and Port Loko District. Operation Northern Push significantly improved the capacity of the Kambia District Ebola Response Centre (DERC) to pro-actively respond to confirmed EVD cases and better anticipate likely case clusters. However, it is recognised that the DERC needs the support of local communities if Kambia district is to reach (and stay) at zero. As such the DERC have introduced a 2nd phase of Operation Northern Push, which will focus on community engagement.Operation Northern Push will establish Section Driven Surveillance and Social Mobilisation Teams (SDSSM) who will be responsible for improving community engagement in their own Sections (sub-sections of a Chiefdom).CAFOD was asked by UNOPS to facilitate the procurement of key items which will be provided to the SDSSM to facilitate Operation Northern Push II.","The HIV and AIDS Inter-Faith Strategy for Sierra Leone will help to secure a sustainable and quality response from various religious and faith based organizations to respond to the issue of HIV and AIDS in the country. It is widely recognized and believed that Sierra Leoneans value their faiths and their faiths influence their behaviors to a large extent.","CAFOD, UNAIDS and National AIDS Secretariat (NAS) are collaborating to conduct an extensive study on understanding the cost drivers for HIV/AIDS treatment in Sierra Leone. Prior to now, no such study has been conducted in HIV/AIDS landscape in Sierra Leone. The result of the study would further help the government, funders and other implementing partners in planning effectively for future expenditure requirements and also identifying strategies for improving the efficiency of HIV treatment programs.","In December 2013, a power struggle within the ruling political party mutated into an armed conflict, first on the streets of the capital Juba, then spreading across the country. During the first six weeks of the crisis, Central Equatoria, Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile states saw heavy fighting between Government and opposition forces.  According to UN OCHA, by March 27th, approximately 803,000 persons have been internally displaced and 254,600 have been made refugees1. The majority of these IDPs are seeking shelter, protection and assistance in UN bases and in churches where no UN bases exist.CAFOD’s local church partners, including the Sacred Heart Sisters and DONBOSCO in Juba as well as Sacred Heart Sisters Malakal and Caritas Malakal in Upper Nile and a number of members of the regional Caritas Confederation; such as Caritas Yei, Juba, CDO in Maban etc. have been receiving traumatized IDPs in their churches since the very beginning of the crisis, offering shelter and any basic assistance they could with the available resources. When listening to the horror stories of what happened in the town of Malakal, it would be unthinkable to imagine someone who went through the ordeal going back there.   Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese Msgr. Roko Taban Mousa said that generally the Diocese is operating from Juba where they have a small liaison office (located in CAFOD) compound, from where they coordinate some activities of the diocese in collaboration with some catechists who are in the villages with the people.A needs assessment was conducted by CAFOD during February 2014 in the target area in Upper Nile State and an urgent need for Food, Non-Food Items (NFI), Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and medical supplies was identified. As a result, the proposed project is intended to support 1,500 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) with multi-sector humanitarian assistance in the Malakal and Melut Counties of Upper Niles state of South Sudan. All 1,500 targeted IDPs are currently camped in different locations in Melut and Malakal, having fled recurrent armed conflict. The target beneficiaries will be provided with Food, NFI, WASH and Health assistance.","This is 12 months HIVandAIDS project targeting the church structures in the Diocese of Tombura-Yambio with the aim of strengthening its capacity in responding to the needs of PLWHA and the community through engaging in awareness raising on HIVand AIDS at diocesan and county levels to increases risk perceptions in the selected parishes/county in order to reduce and prevent infection and Re-infection among the community. The project targets to train religious leaders, peer educators, PLWHA and other diocesan level actors; a total of 1055 people in the selected parishes/counties will be reached directly while an estimated 15,000 at risk population in the targeted parishes will indirectly be reached by the project through local media.Following CDTY’s three year project from April 2010 to March 2012 and its one year project from April 2013 – March 2014, considerable achievements have been observed through an external evaluation and the diocese themselves. A number of lessons have been learnt, and despite the wide range of achievements made so far, there are still some significant challenges being faced. The design of this proposed project is therefore based on information collected during recent project monitoring visits conducted by CAFOD, Caritas Australia and CDTY. It will also continue to  addressed some of the gaps that were identified by the external evaluation report and the 2013 project","Following the conflict crisis of 15th December 2013, which displaced tens of thousands of families inside and outside South Sudan, Caritas South Sudan (CSS) with CAFOD funding started an emergency response project which supported IDPs with construction of latrines and food aid. CSS was engaged in further or subsequent rapid assessments and identified needs of IDPs and returnees is a number of the following counties/payam locations in Central Equatoria state: Kajo Keji county (town and Liwolo payam), Yei county (town, Lasu and Tore payams) and Lainya county (Lainya and Mukaya payams). A total of 37,157 individuals (IDPs and returnees) are targeted. Of these 22,294 persons will be female and 14,863 males. Caritas South Sudan (CSS) seeks to support these vulnerable people through provision of food aid, clean drinking water, emergency shelter materials, agriculture inputs (seeds and tools), public health/hygiene promotion and support to health care and psycho-social support to increase their resilience in the face of looming hunger gap and susceptibility to increased incidences of weather related diseases during the coming rainy season; especially towards March/April. These disaster-affected people (IDPs and returnees) have also lost homes and livelihood assets, especially women will be supported, but men will also benefit from the project. The wider target host community members (about 61,657 people) will benefit indirectly through the hygiene awareness and promotion activities and from the rehabilitation of water sources e.g. digging shallow wells, protecting spring wells, repair of hand pumps. The project implementation, by CSS will be directly supported by the County RRC in Kajo Keji, Yei and Lainya counties. Whereas the beneficiaries will also be involved in project implementation e.g. through distribution committees, local leaders mobilizing people to participate in hygiene promotion awareness through messaging etc.","This project is intending to improve public interest issues advocacy and lobby engagement at the National level. The advocacy and lobby will covers issues associated with peace agreement, Aug.2015 matters centred on effective and timely implementation of the peace agreement provisions. Among the key peace agreement provisions are; institutional and legislations reforms, observation of permanent ceasefire, justice and accountability, national reconciliation and healing  security sector reform and economic reforms. The advocacy and lobby will target the central government level targeting the national parliament, independent commissions and executive ministries. This project will be focusing on conducting advocacy and lobby for the effective and timely implementation of the signed peace agreement between the government and the SPLM-IO. The advocacy and lobby for the effective and timely implementation of the peace agreement is approached in two components as follow;Component 1: Sensitization of the communities on the peace agreementThis component is aiming at disseminating the peace agreement to the members of the communities. The dissemination methods will be radio talk shows, public dialogues, and public lecture.Component 2: Monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the peace agreementThis component is aiming at creating pressure for the parties to the peace agreement for effective and timely implementation of the agreement. This component will be implemented through round tables, radio talk shows, public debates, diplomatic lobby and press engagement.The purpose of designing the project in this manner was due to the experiences learned from the Comprehensive Peace Agreement-CPA, 2015 implementation history. The CPA implementation process was much of the parties to the agreement responsibility. This resulted for them to ineffectively and timely implement the CPA, 2015. Evidences were the failure of the parties to CPA implementation decisively reject to commit themselves for realization of national reconciliation and protocol on Abyei.Therefore this project will be public interest advocacy for the effectively and timely implementation of the South Sudan peace Agreement, 2015. The direct beneficiaries of this project will be civil society and the indirect beneficiaries will the communities and state institutions namely national parliament, national peace and reconciliation commission, Truth, Healing and Reconciliation commission and others.","This 12 month project will continue to contribute to Western Equatoria State’s HIV and AIDS framework by raising awareness among rural communities.  The aim is to increase community knowledge on how to reduce and prevent new HIV transmissions, especially among the most at-risk populations (young people and women men and children) The project will adopt a strong media strategy as a method of reaching the wider public. There will also be an integrated element of livelihoods through agriculture components, in order to provide better nutrition to PLHA.  It will also enhance asset building and income generation which will help the support groups meet their immediate costs, such as transport to access treatment. Income generation activities will also help them run individual business and access markets.  As a result of this project there will be increased community awareness on HIV and AIDS prevention, care and support, increased advocacy and networking around HIV and AIDS issues, increased knowledge on nutrition, increased asset bases and household income leading to increased access to treatment, strengthened capacities of communities, HIV and AIDS structures and support groups, and an overall increased appreciation of HIV and AIDS issues contributing towards a reduction of stigma  and discrimination  hence  community acceptance of PLWHA.","In Kotido Diocese, 41,800 HHs are in dire need of food as a result of prolonged drought from July – October 2015. Households were increasingly applying coping strategies such as; reduced number of meals per day (2 meals), reliance on firewood and charcoal burning for income, movements within and out of districts in search of food and increased sale of livestock. According to an assessment done by WFP in October 2015, 14 sub counties are at high risk.",null,"The HIV and AIDS pandemic is a problem which affects all levels of society in Zambia and it is directly linked to poverty. According to World Bank  statistics available at national level in Zambia 13.5% of the adult population is infected with HIV and AIDS , while UNFPA  states that the national HIV prevalence rate among adults 15-49 years currently stands at 14.3%, which is a decline from 15.6%.  The challenge remains halving new HIV infections by 2015 when only 25% of adult Zambians have been tested for HIV.  Gender inequality has been identified as a structural factor driving the HIV and AIDS epidemic in Zambia.Statistics available in Zambia seem to point to the fact that , women have a higher prevalence rate of 16.1% compared to men at 12.3%. Mbala is the furthest part of Northern Zambia and close to Tanzanian border and lake Tanganuika leading to the DRC and Congo. The major driver of HIV is poverty, leading many to risky behaviours, such as transactional sex, cross border trading, early marriages, lack of employment and hence risky survival tactics come into play.Because of its location and distance from the main developments in Lusaka or Ndola the major cities of Zambia, the Sacred Heart Sisters devoted their time to working with the poorest communities of Mbala and Mpulungu in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Services are poor and there are distances that are prohibitive for some communities to access health delivery services let alone schools. There approach has been prevention is better than cure and  community education through various means. This project therefore aims at contributing to the reduction in the spread of HIV and AIDS and its impact in communities of Mbala.","Through this project, St Theresa Mission Hospital, aims to improve the quality of life of people living with and affected by HIV, and reduce vulnerability to HIV, in rural Ibenga, Zambia. It aims to do this through working with local communities, faith leaders, traditional leaders and High School authorities, because these groups have broad reach and influence.The project focuses on:- Increasing knowledge and uptake of HIV prevention services- Reducing vulnerability of children and youths to HIV- Reducing stigma and discrimination of people living with and/or affected by HIV and AIDS- Increasing livelihood opportunities, and therefore health status, of people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, including orphans and vulnerable children (through e.g. savings and lending activities)- Strengthen the capacity of Ibenga staff and care givers to deliver quality services in their communityThis project will include working with 19 schools on prevention campaigns, providing full and accurate information on methods of HIV prevention care and support.The project will be implemented in five sites, reaching approximately 16,400 people. Recognising that HIV has a disproportionate effect on women and children, there will be a particular focus on women, orphans and other vulnerable children.","This project continues the work since 1993 of the St Francis Community Integrated Care Programme in improving the quality of life of people living with and affected by HIV; and reducing vulnerability to HIV and the impact of AIDS in the Livingstone district of Zambia.Working with volunteers (care supporters), faith leaders and staff, the project will:- provide increased access and utilisation of quality and comprehensive palliative care services, including voluntary counselling and testing, ART adherence support, prevention of mother to child transmission;- reduce stigma and discrimination through education, campaigns and training of faith leaders;- improve livelihoods and food security through the introduction of savings and lending schemes and training in farming and horticulture topics;- develop awareness of human rights issues, particularly for women and children, and child protection matters;- provide training and support for care supporters, in order to increase their recruitment and retention.","This project continues the efforts of Ndola Diocese to improve the quality of life of people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and reduce vulnerability to HIV infection. Working with local communities, faith leaders, traditional leaders, school authorities and other institutions, it will:- improve the quality of life of people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, including orphans and vulnerable children, through: training and support to caregivers on psychosocial, medical, human rights, gender, health and child protection issues; income generation training; scaled up home-based care; education support for the most disadvantaged children; and support for abused women;- increase knowledge and uptake of HIV prevention services, through awareness and prevention training and the facilitation of support groups;- reduce the vulnerability of children and youths to HIV, through life skills and behaviour change training, sports and drama activities;- reduce discrimination against those living with or affected by HIV and AIDS, through sensitisation training and through refresher training for faith leaders on HIV counselling and mentoring.","This project in the Archdiocese of Lusaka, Zambia, aims to address the issues around HIV infections (22% infected in Lusaka), and alleviate the suffering of the poorest of the poor in the 39 communities where Archdiocese of Lusaka operates.It seeks to:- Improve knowledge, attitudes and practices around HIV prevention, leading to a reduction in higher-risk behaviours and reduced vulnerability to new infections- Increase access services and support, enabling people living with HIV (PLHIV) to live healthier and more productive lives- Improve household food security and income of PLHIV through providing access to entrepreneurial training, savings and lending opportunities- Reduce stigma and discrimination against PLHIV, leading to increased health-seeking behaviourThe Archdiocese of Lusaka will be working in 31 sites under CAFOD and the other 8 home-based care (HBC) projects being supported by Misereor. Currently the programme has 12,088 orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) who need support holistically, and 8,524 patients needing support.","This project aims to contribute to the reduction of HIV incidence among young people in Livingstone and Lusaka.Current rates of transmission in these urban areas are 25.4% and 20.8% respectively, driven by factors such as: multiple and concurrent sexual partners; activities of sex workers and men who have sex with men; high levels of mobility and labour migration; low and inconsistent condom use; low levels of male circumcision; and mother-to-child transmission. These factors are exacerbated by widespread poverty; underfunded and inadequate educational facilities; poor access to health services and HIV prevention in schools; and gender roles that discriminate against women.The project is designed to reduce these rates through the education of young people in life skills to address these issues, and support of young people through clubs and sports activities. In addition, teachers, parents and other stakeholders will be supported through workshops and other forms of information dissemination.The project will be implemented over 3 years. CAFOD will contribute a third of the total budget whilst the remainder is met by Misereor.","This project aims to mitigate the impact of HIV by improving the quality of life of people living with HIV and reducing vulnerability to new HIV infections in urban, peri-urban and rural Lusaka Province and the Central Province of Zambia.In Zambia, HIV and AIDS continue to be the major developmental challenge, with approximately 1 million people infected. Lusaka has a prevalence rate of approximately 22%, contributing to the national prevalence which still remains at above 20% and making Zambia one of the countries in Southern Africa hardest hit by HIV and AIDS.This project is holistic in addressing the major HIV challenges as highlighted by the communities within the Archdiocese of Lusaka, which include stigma. The four specific areas of action are:1. Reduce stigma and discrimination against PLHIV;2. Improve knowledge, attitudes and practices around HIV prevention;3. Increase access to services and support;4. Increase access to entrepreneurial training, savings and lending opportunities.","In Zambia HIV and AIDS continues to be the major developmental challenge, with approximately 1 million people infected.

Like other sub-Saharan countries, it is already suffering from the effects of climate change. There has been a decline in rainfall and as such Zambia is experiencing more frequent and intense dry spells. These trends are expected to intensify in the future with projected temperatures expected to increase by at least 2°C by 2070 (PPCR, 2014).  Analysis from the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) shows that the climate change has a large impact on development in Zambia, and the climate variability includes low frequency-high impact, extreme weather events (e.g. droughts and floods) and high probability-low impact weather events (e.g. erratic rainfall, warmer days and nights). This has affected yields in most parts of the country and has seen an increase in the price of maize (staple food requirement in Zambia) and common vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and rape. According to the Central Statistics Office  the price of a 20 litre maize grain, 1 kg of Chinese cabbage and 1 kg of rape has increased by 20%, 15% and 29% respectively from May 2015 -May 2016. The increase in such essential foods has led to most community members on BLF project to have poorer nutrition which is a disadvantage on their health because they are living with HIV.The project communities who were provided with agricultural inputs (maize seed and fertilizer) last year (2015), experienced erratic rainfall which led to late germination and therefore resulted into a poor yield in most sites. The poor yield on the project has resulted in reduced income for most of the communities because it now means that their yield will be for consumption at the household level and selling. If the yield was abundant, the communities would earn some income through selling the surplus. In addition, the poor yield also means a lack of surplus maize seed that can be shared with other communities, thereby inhibiting the scale-up of the livelihood intervention on the BLF project. In order to mitigate (both prevent and pre-empt) the impact of change in climate, several interventions are hereby proposed to create a more sustainable and resilient approach towards livelihood in the affected communities.","St Francis Community Integrated Care Programme is situated in the Southern Province of Zambia and in the Catholic Diocese of Livingstone.

Maize flour micronutrient fortification will be done by hammer millers. Small scale millers will be identified and trained on food fortification, they will be introduced to the innovative technology to do the fortification, along with the micronutrient premix powders. The technology will be installed and a three month trial period will start. During this period the millers will be given the premix for free and they will fortify the maize meal of their customers. After the three month trial period to get the premix the millers will have to contribute capital to get the premix until they are self sufficient. Behaviour change strategies as well as nutrition education will be introduced in the community to increase nutrition security.","This project aims to achieve improved livelihoods security for poor women, men and children from hazard-prone or marginalised rural communities in Gokwe North through an integrated approach that: increases the productivity and resilience of agricultural systems; strengthens engagement in markets and diversified income generation; strengthens adaptation to climate change; and increases the ability of local, pro-poor farm and producer groups to access services and influence development practices.

The Church through ZCBC Education Commission will develop technical and functional capacities of targeted implementing structures (including churches, schools and care institutions) to ensure that the Child Protection Policy is implemented in an efficient and effective manner warranting sustainability of the project results.The project will train 400 Clergy and Religious Men and Women on child protection and to reach out to their respective parishes and communities, establishing community Child Protection Committees. 400 teachers in Catholic Institutions will be trained directly (TOTs) and they will in turn cascade the training to the 5,000 teachers working in Catholic schools. In Schools, teachers will train children, develop Child- Led Committees and establish Child Protection ClubsThe primary beneficiaries of this project are the children and vulnerable adults in 108 Catholic Primary Schools, 102 Catholic Secondary Schools, 18 Skills Training Centres, 1 Primary Teachers’ College and 1 University, 20 Children’s homes as well as 55 Catholic Hospitals and Parishes in Zimbabwe.","St Albert’s Mission Hospital as the District hospital has the role to maximise the dissemination of information and provision of services as well as advocating for policies towards extermination of the transmission of HIV/AIDS. This project aims at improving the  quality of life of people living with disability, young women and those affected by HIV, and reduce vulnerability to new incidences of HIV in rural areas of Centenary District of Mashonaland Central, Chinhoyi Diocese, Zimbabwe by 2020Expected project Outcomes1. Reduction of Stigma and discrimination against people living with disability, PLWHIV, leading to increased health-seeking behaviour.2. Improved knowledge, attitudes and practices around HIV prevention, leading to a reduction in higher-risk behaviours and reduced vulnerability to new infections3. An increased number of PLHIV access services and support, enabling them to live healthier and more productive lives4. Capacity building of the district, ward and village community systems to identify and address barriers and hindrances in accessing PMTCT servicesSt Alberts has seen at the Shelter and in the surrounding communities early indulgence in sexual activities and this has been noted as one of the causes of HIV transmission (WHO, 2007). According to the DHS (2010-11), 24% of young women age 15-19 have already begun child bearing where 19% of them are mothers and an additional 15% are pregnant with their first child. At this this age these young women have limited capacity to negotiate for safer sex hence the high risk of HIV vulnerability, resulting in the incidence of new HIV infections in the District.","Mashambanzou has been responding to HIV and AIDS in the poorest communities of Zimbabwe in the past 26 years. During their strategic review meeting there was strong emphasis on scaling up prevention work especially amongst the key populations who according to National AIDS Council are the youth and the commercial sex workers. Zimbabwe has the fifth highest HIV prevalence in Sub Saharan Africa at 15%. 1.4 million People are living with HIV including 170000 children equating to 4% of the Global total 14.7% adult prevalence rate.According to statistics released 2010, 59% of PLWHIV are still not accessing treatment. At the Durban Conference held last year 2016, it was reinforced that if no scaling up is done; 10.9 million people will die by 2030. New infections are also a cause of concern, which puts so much pressure on the already constrained Health budget.. In the ZNASP 111, stakeholders identified gains made to date and that promotion of smart investment is focused for high interventions targeting children, adolescents, young people, and key populations – women in sex work, women and people living with disability.Mashambanzou theory of change has  four pillars of :1. Gender, Human Rights Environment and Legal Support.2. Treatment and support of PLWHIV3. Psychosocial Support4. Socioeconomic Supportall anchoring on ensuring that communities that Mashambanzou works in are healthy and resilient. This project will focus on working on interventions targeting children, adolescents, young people, and key populations – women in sex work, women and people living with disabilities in the affected communities Glen Norah, Hopley and Nyabira.The focus of the interventions will also include internationally recommended approaches such as:1. Comprehensive case management and referrals2. Behaviour change programme that incorporate SRHR and Child Protection for the youth and adolescents3.Engaging youth /children living with HIV for both treatment care and support as well as stigma reduction.4.Promote economic empowerment and livelihoods for support group members.","An important but currently neglected threat for the development of active tuberculosis (TB) is diabetes, which increase the risk of clinical TB several fold. In this proposal, we take advantage of a well-established collaboration with Bangladesh to explore the role of diabetes in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic TB disease. We will use patients samples collected in well-designed clinical studies and advanced immunological techniques to carefully characterize macrophage function as well as the behaviour and relevance of peripheral lymphocyte responses involved in TB and how these are affected by concomitant diabetes disease. Our research constellation has also developed novel concepts for immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy of TB that will be evaluated in patients with diabetes. Here, a novel B cell test will be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of active TB in patient cohorts recruited in a high-prevalence setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In a clinical trial, we will also study if novel inducers of antimicrobial peptides, phenylbutyrate and vitamin D, can restore immune function and insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients with TB. Our ambition is to promote knowledge and technology transfer between the collaborating institutions, partly by local PhD and postdoc training, to gain synergistic effects on the discovery of clinically relevant targets that could be used to improve medical management and general health of patients with TB and diabetes.","Betel chewing is prevalent in Asia including among women in pregnancy. Betel is known as carcinogenic but little is known about health risks for mother and fetus. Studies suggest that health risks are similar to that of undernourishment in early life; adverse pregnancy outcome, poor fetal and infant growth and increased risk for metabolic syndrome in adulthood. Thus if poor nutrition and betel chewing are combined synergetic affects are plausible. Set in a rural Bangladesh the aim is to evaluate the health consequences for mother and offspring of betel chewing. A community based cohort of 4700 pregnant women will be followed repeatedly from gestation wk 8-10 until infant is 1y. Outcome data on maternal nutrition (wt, ht, body composition, skinfolds, circumferences) and metabolic status (insulin, glucose, lipid profile, blood pressure) fetal growth (ultrasound), adverse pregnancy outcome, size at birth, growth and infant nutritional status (wt, ht, skinfolds, circumferences) be collected. Proposed mechanisms for the toxicity of betel chewing will be evaluated by biomarkers (vit D, vit B-12, folate, crp, agp) in blood samples in pregnancy, at delivery (cord) and infancy. Exposure assessment will include the different ingredients in betel chew and indicators developed that will enable dose-effect analyses of exposure on the outcomes. As the research team includes capacity of large scale interventions it is expected that research results rapidly may be turned into action","Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) are common infections in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). ETEC gives rise to watery diarrhea, causing 400 000 deaths/year, primarily in young children. LMIC children are also often chronically infected with Hp and in 15-20% of cases, the infection causes symptoms later in life such as peptic ulcers or gastric cancer. Our recent results suggest that CD4+ T helper cells, particularly those that secrete the cytokine IL-17A (Th17), play important roles in promoting protective immune mechanisms in both infections. The overall aim of this project is to advance the knowledge we have recently gained on Th17 responses in different model systems to human ETEC and Hp infection. This includes (I) to characterize T helper cell responses to these infections in humans and (II) to study the functional capacity of novel mucosal vaccine adjuvants to enhance human CD4+ T helper cell responses. This collaborative project, performed at the University of Gothenburg and the International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, will benefit from the combined expertise of the applicants, including broad knowledge in techniques for analyzing T cell responses and extensive experience of studies of mucosal immunity in LMIC. The project also aims to establish a framework for mutual learning and training of PhD students and younger scientists at both sites, forming a basis for extended future collaboration.",null,"Spinal cord injury is an important public health problem creating several physical, social and economic problems. In low income countries, without social support system and governmental assistances, spinal cord injury victims suffer a lot. We have several studies from high income countries on this issue and prevention, but no study from low income country. This study has intended to develop a prevention framework of spinal cord injuries in Bangladesh. This study will first determine the physical, mental, social and economic consequences of spinal cord injuries in Bangladesh. Then ask the victims, their family members, physicians, nurses and social workers about their opinion on preventing spinal cord injuries. Five specific objectives:1)To measure the quality of life of people with spinal cord injury. 2)To measure different levels of participation restriction in major domains of life of spinal cord injury victims. 3) To estimate the costs of rehabilitation programs and total cost of a large group of spinal cord injury victims. 4) To develop a prevention framework for SCI from views of health and social service (care) providers? of SCI victims. 5)To assess victims? knowledge of SCI and develop a prevention protocol for SCI from victims? perspective.

Malaria puts a heavy burden on the economic progress of the afflicted countries, especially in the low-income strata of those societies. Despite the severity of the problem, global efforts to combat malaria remain minor, allegedly since this disease mostly affects developing countries, with limited economic power. No efficient malaria vaccine has been developed, and resistance existing antimalarial drugs is emerging. However, with the recent support of international charities, this may change. This project aims at identifying novel promising lead antimalarial compounds, with a special view to combat P. vivax, the major malaria-causing parasite in Latin America. Frontline techniques in yeast genomics will be used to identify the targets of molecules with antiplasmodial activity, and to improve the selectivity for the parasite ortholog of the target over the human counterpart. The Brazilian partners contribute knowledge about growth and genetic engineering of the malaria parasite, as well as of its pathogenesis and malaria epidemiology. The Swedish partners contribute high-throughput yeast genetic screening methodology and medicinal chemistry for redesign and development of leads. We intend to establish a long-lasting international collaboration in this field of great global importance.","Procurement, framework agreement audit of project 54000032.

A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has given to all children in Ethiopia since 2011, but the effect on the disease is not known. The good response seen in USA and Europa may not be repeated because of diferences in serotype distribution and virulence among strains of some serotypes. We plan to investigate the serotype distribution and resistance among pneumococci from children with clinical infections and asymptomatic carriers. Clinical data and level of antibiotic resistance will be related to the serotypes in available vaccines. Indoor air pollution has been found to be a leading cause of morbidity where the food is cooked on open fire with insufficient ventilation. The children in the houses are exposed to smoke, which is likely to be a risk factor for respiratory infections. The air quality will be determined by measuring the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration since CO is a known tracer of incomplete combustion. However, the relation between carbon monoxide levels, airway inflammation and bacteriology in children has not been studied. 100 children living in homes where the food is cooked indoors on open fire without chimney will be compared with 100 children from homes with other forms of cooking. We also plan to study the effect of an intervention with a sun-powered fan.","Poverty alleviation requires sustained economic growth, good governance and political stability.

Unlike food and medical supplies which are often provided instantly for refugees and displaced people, the SRHR services and needs are largely overlooked in response to relief assistance for refugees. However, they are of no less importance to the refugees as women, girls and children, who constitute the big majority of the refugee population, suffer disproportionately from sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), unwanted pregnancies, unsafe delivery and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV and AIDS. In most conflict settings these risks are heightened as women and girls lack means to protect themselves and their families. Without targeted SRHR intervention women and girls face an increased risk of early and forced marriage, sexual abuse and exchanging of sex for basic goods. The intervention will help increase availability of women friendly spaces to create women’s and girls’ awareness on and risk reduction of SGBV, post abortion care, treatment of STIs and HIV testing kits.The intervention will target 277,756 people of which 188,875 are South Sudan refugees located in Leitchor, Terkidi and&Kule refugee camps in NyeinNyang, Lare and Itang Woredas and 88,881 are surrounding host communities in the same Woreda.The intervention aims to help increase improved availability, access and use of comprehensive SRHR services, reduced prevalence of sexual gender-based violence (SGBV); Increased access and utilization of Basic Emergency Obstetric and New-born Care (BEmONC) and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and New-born care (CEmONC) services; and reduced incidence of HIV among the refugees and the host communities..Given that refugees reside alongside host communities, the needs of host communities and refugees are inextricably linked. Public services in host communities surrounding the refugees are usually stretched beyond their capacity as they are facing an unprecedented increase in demand for health and other social services. To mitigate the impact of refugee on host communities, the intervention will reinforce basic services to host populations. It will also provide lifesaving medical assistance, reproductive and maternal drugs, equipment and supplies, train health staffs and buffer them through secondment of staffs and strengthen the referral system through provision of ambulances to increase the provision of services.In both refugee and host communities, adolescent and young people reproductive health services are provided in the context of general health services. In order to create access to family planning service, treatment of STIs/HIV, post abortion care, and information on for young peoples without barrier, the intervention will provide adolescent and youth focused reproductive health services and information. It will also produce Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials on RH, HIV and GBV materials in local language and distribute to the refugees and local communities through camp and local health facilities and encourage their adoption. By doing so, the intervention will address the aforementioned critical gaps in the area of RH, GBV and HIV.A total of 11,2 MSEK budget has been allocated for the intervention to be implemented from December 2014-December 2015.","AHRI works to meet the reseach and capacity building demands of Ethiopia in biomedical fields.

Our project aim to understand the impact of worms and worm proteins on development and control of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and determine if de-worming can enhance immune responses and facilitate clearance of Leishmania donovani and thereby improve the efficacy of already existing drugs anti-leishmanials. We want to test this experimentally and in a clinical trial. Worms, being potent inducers of Th2 and regulatory responses, can be envisaged to affect the ability of the host to respond to Th1 controlled infections (e.g. Leishmania). The drugs (e.g. pentavalent antimonials, SbV) commonly used against leishmaniasis depend on host residual immunity to clear parasite infection. Thus, boosting Th1 immunity may enhance therapeutic efficacy, as suggested by combined therapy with the Th1 cytokine IFNg and SbV, which promoted parasite clearance over SbV monotherapy. Human VL is suitable as a model for a human disease where deworming can be envisaged to have impact. VL patients are hospitalized and the treatment time is manageable 15-30 days. Analysis of proteins from human worms may allow identification of immune modulatory proteins specific for human worms, which may be a contributing or underlying factor to immune failure in patients developing VL disease. Targeting such molecules may be used to treatments worms and to enhance control of co-infection.","Gastric Helicobacter pylori infection is the main cause of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Remarkably, an estimated 80-90% of the adults in low and middle income countries are infected with H. pylori. An estimated 10-15% of the infected individuals will develop peptic ulcer disease and 1-2% gastric cancer. Antibiotic treatment can cure peptic ulcer disease but reinfection is common. From a public health perspective, a vaccine against H. pylori will reduce the consumption of antibiotics, the incidence of associated symptoms and rate of reinfections. The main target group for such a vaccine would be adults in low and middle income countries where H. pylori infection is endemic. Our group at the University of Gothenburg (UG) has been working for the last 20 years on the development of a mucosally delivered vaccine against H. pylori infection. Based on the results from our pre-clinical studies, a vaccine candidate will be chosen to advance to Phase I clinical trials in H. pylori infected adults and later in children in close collaboration with an industrial partner. The vaccine will be scaled up for production under GMP conditions. Pre-vaccine specific immune responses in H. pylori infected individuals in India will be studied and a Phase I trial will be carried out in India. Considering the previous experience at UG in developing mucosal vaccines, we are optimistic that we could develop an effective and low-cost H. pylori vaccine under the framework of this application.","Con la implementación del presente proyecto se pretende consolidar el modelo de gestión que se ha venido desarrollando en la zona desde hace 6 años para disminuir la incidencia de Chagas y mejorar las condiciones de salud de la población.

Endémica en 21 países latinoamericanos. Se asocia a la exclusión socioeconómica. La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OPS) estima que afecta a 8 millones de personas y provoca cerca de 12.000 muertes al año (Anexo1). Es una infección crónica y silenciosa, con una gran carga de morbilidad-mortalidad y discapacidad. Su transmisión es vectorial, transfusional y congénita. Ocasiona graves complicaciones cardíacas y gastrointestinales, asintomáticas incluso por años. En Bolivia, cerca de un millón de personas padecen esta enfermedad, 670.000 de ellas en Cochabamba (Anexo2). En la zona de intervención, Milloma, según últimos datos de ADIO, el Chagas es prácticamente endémico con una tasa de incidencia del 57% sobre una población total de 1.487 personas (754 mujeres y 733 hombres). Este proyecto de crisis crónica es la Fase II de otro financiado por la AACID y actualmente en ejecución. Hasta la fecha se ha diagnosticado a 599 personas (40% de la población), de las que 341 están contagiadas (57% de la muestra). De ellas, el 75% ha realizado tratamiento. Complementariamente se ha desarrollado el manual IEC (Información, Educación y Comunicación), informando a la población sobre síntomas y medidas de prevención del Chagas. Uno de los factores que más contribuye a la presencia del vector son las precarias condiciones de habitabilidad de las viviendas. Actualmente se están mejorando 150 de ellas, habiéndose concluido 75. Desde la experiencia adquirida identificamos que es necesario: fortalecer el rol de las mujeres, muy vinculado al cuidado de la salud de las familias y continuar incidiendo en la promoción de hábitos saludables. Ambas estrategias profundizarán el alcance de las acciones y aumentaran su sostenibilidad. Así, para la fase II se propone: A. Promoción de la salud. Se dará continuidad al diagnóstico mediante campañas intensivas por comunidad; tratamiento de las personas infectadas; seguimiento periódico a las personas enfermas ya tratadas por si presentaran alteraciones cardiacas o gástricas y control permanente a niñas y niños a través de las pruebas rápidas. B. Fortalecimiento de las organizaciones de mujeres en cada Comunidad. Se las capacitará para realizar una gestión comunitaria efectiva y que sean las encargadas de la prevención del Chagas. Vigilarán domicilios para reportar la presencia del vector y gestionar el rociamiento selectivo. C. Mejoramiento de las condiciones de habitabilidad. Se continuará con el mejoramiento de 40 viviendas. D. La mejora del ambiente de la cocina y la incidencia para la incorporación de hábitos saludables será la necesidad práctica desde la que se apoye también el empoderamiento de la organización de mujeres y se promueva la visibilización y reconocimiento de las tareas de cuidados que realizan.","Bolivia 2015 Medio Ambiente Plantas Residuales","GESTION COMUNITARIA DEL AGUA POTABLE Y EDUCACIÓN SANITARIA EN LA COMUNIDAD INDÍGENA CRUZANI, MUNICIPIO TIQUIPAYA.

Worst affected are poor people living in vulnerable communities in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Vector control by insecticides is the dominant way to combat and prevent transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. Due to globalization, environmental changes and increased insecticide resistance, there is an urgent need for new approaches and strategies for efficient vector control. This proposal aims to design, synthesize and develop multiple novel chemical classes of insecticides for control of Aedes aegypti (transmits e.g. dengue and chikungunya) and Anopheles gambiae (transmits malaria). We will target a form of acetylcholinesterase (AChE1) not present in vertebrates, and identify diverse selective chemical starting points by high throughput screening (HTS). Evaluation of a performed HTS targeting mosquito AChE1 has shown promising results. We have identified several classes of substances that are selective for the mosquito-form over human AChE. These multiple chemical starting points will be synthetically explored and optimized into insecticides. Early on in the discovery process we will include, in addition to the target-specific endpoints, response estimates that address human safety, environmental fate and effect, resistance sensitivity, and cost of goods. Mosquito testing, including laboratory testing and field studies, will be performed in Kenya.","Insect vectors transmit numerous viral- and parasite infections between humans or from animals to humans.

Specifically, we will investigate how infant morbidity due to diarrheal disease is associated with rotavirus antibody, maternal antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimen and exclusive breastfeeding. Methods: Capacity building will be achieved through technology transfer from Sweden, on-site training and workshops at KEMRI and courses at Karolinska Institutet. Laboratory capabilities will be expanded to conduct assays of neutralizing antibodies against HIV and rotavirus. These assays will be run on infant specimens available from a previous Kenyan study and results linked to clinical details. Epidemiological models will be used to estimate how the risk of infant diarrheal disease depends on the interplay between passive immunity, maternal ART and breastfeeding. Significance: High-quality affordable laboratory tests and a core group of highly trained researchers will set the foundation for dissemination of Kenyan research capacity. Identification of neutralizing antibodies against HIV can help identify candidate vaccines. The findings on infant morbidity may suggest modifications in breastfeeding practice or ART, or additional booster vaccinations for infants of HIV-positive mothers.","To strengthen the capacities of the Kimron Veterinary Institute (MARD) and supervision of private accredited laboratories to achieve rapid and effective surveillance and control of animal diseases as well as  provision of reliable evidence to certify animals and animal-origin products as safe, especially for human consumption, up to EU and OIE standards.","Title: To build the capacity of the Ministry of Women, Children and Youth Affairs in implementing the End Child Marriage Programme","We Effect frame agreement, Sida/CIVSAM, 2014-2016 and 2017","Frame work agreement support to Diakonia's activities in developing countries for 2015.","Pingst FFS/PMU, Pentecostal Alliance, phase out support as framework organiastion.

While the host-organism exposure to microbes set the prerequisite for interactions, also inherent properties of the host organism are expected to affect the relationship. Two vector mosquitoes of great importance are the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae and Aedes albopictus, vector of Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. The possibility to negatively impact vector competence by interfering with the host-microbial relationship is the long-term purpose of this project. However, to achieve interference, we need to better understand the bacterial relationship with the mosquito hosts. What is affecting the gut flora composition in mosquitoes, the ecological niche or host-specific physiological factors or both? The rationale is to compare the microbial flora composition of two vector mosquito species that have completely distinct ecologies, and investigate what effect on fitness the gut flora play. The aims presented here will give responses to fundamental questions in microbial ecology that only could be investigated in controlled lab settings. How will the microbial composition change in both species when bred in the same environment? Which is the mode of bacterial transfer between mosquitoes? What impact does the gut microbial-flora have on basal systemic immune activity and fecundity?","Title: Storage and Distribution of Family Planning Commodities in Kenya - Population Services International","Framework agreement with Individuell Människohjälp during the period 2015-2017 within the strategy for support via Swedish civil society organisations","Frame work agreement support to Diakonia's activities in developing countries for 2015.","Title: Procurement of Equipment to Support the Adolescent Girls initiative to benefit 3000 girls in Kenya","Technical Assistance for development of compensation fund in case of animal disease outbreaks and other services.","Twinning project aimed to assist in preparation of the strategies for upgrading of establishments and animal by-product management and the associated training and awareness raising.",null,"Supply of IT equipment for surveilance of animal diseases.","Improvement of solid waste management in municipalities Sremska Mitrovica and Sabac - introduction of primary waste separation","Improvement of solid waste management - introduction of primary waste separation in municipalities of Babusnica and Dimitrovgrad","Improvement of solid waste management - closure of dumpsites in municipalities of Surdulica and Vladicin Han","Housing solutions","return disssemination and information return facilitation .Conduction of outreach campaign provision of individual IDP return support packages community actions implementation of coordination efforts","The results to be achieved are:- durable housing solutions for 16 IDP families;- improvement of economic capacities of 10 IDP families;- enhanced social integration of beneficiaries.","To improve the capacities of social inclusion and health care of the Mental Health (MH) system in Serbia and BiH through cross-border exchange of experiences","Overall objectives- to support sustainable changes in mental health practices- improve the mental health and wellbeing of the population in Valjevo area- reduce the treatment gap and scale up mental health services","The supply, delivery, training and installation of 12 video-colonoscope systems to be distributed in the health care institutions in Serbia.","The supply, delivery, training and installation of microscopes, autostainers and glass coverslippers for cytology labs to be distributed in the health care institutions in Serbia.","The supply, delivery, training and installation of IT equipment to be distributed in the health care institutions in Serbia.","The overall aim of the project is the development of a regional waste management to improve access to, and delivery of environmental services and facilities in waste management.The main focus of this contract will be the construction of a regional waste management centre that meet EU Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC.

Poryecto: Se trata de construir un pabellón de 137,5 m cuadrados: Una gran sala de hospitalización y 3 habitaciones y dos baños internos para el servicio de pediatría y ginecología.Este pabellón iría anexo a un centro médico ya construido y financiado por la Diputación de Palencia. El terreno se cede por la Comunidad de P. Barnabitas., adjuntos al socio local. Posteriormente se dotará de mobiliario. Las familias se implican en la ejecución del proyecto. ","Título completo del proyecto: Fortalecimiento de la salud materno-infantil y mejora de la atención primaria de salud dirigida especialmente a mujeres e infancia en situación de pobreza en comunidades rurales de Mokambo: Operaciones que dan vida. República Democrática del Congo :: Construcción de un espacio adecuado para la realización de cirugías en el centro de salud y maternidad Marie Auxiliatrice de Mokambo, mejorando el servicio sanitario ofrecido en un área sanitaria de ámbito rural. ","El proyecto se localiza en el Este de la RDC, una zona en proceso de estabilización de las instituciones tras más de una década de conflicto, desde que a finales de los 90 fuera identificada la importante riqueza minera que se encuentra en su territorio. La población continua padeciendo un proceso de empobrecimiento sostenido y el país ostenta la penúltima posición en las clasificaciones relativas al IDH e IDG (PNUD, 2013). El impacto de esta situación es desigual en función del género, de forma que progresivamente aumentan la cuota de poder de los hombres y la discriminación de mujeres y niñas, que padecen mayores vulneraciones de sus DDHH y DESCA. Las provincias Kivu Norte (donde se localiza la intervención) y Sur acumulan el 50% de los casos de violencia sexual del país. Si bien se trata de la forma más conocida de violencia no es la única: violencia conyugal, abuso psicológico, tráfico, prostitución forzada, acoso sexual, prácticas tradicionales perjudiciales (MGF, levirato, matrimonios forzados, etc.), son otras formas de violencia habitual contra mujeres y niñas de la zona. La generalización de las vulneraciones de los DD.HH de mujeres y niñas se relaciona con la impunidad en que se desarrolla la actividad de los diferentes grupos armados presentes en la zona; aunque también hace referencia a las condiciones en que se ha normalizado la violencia como expresión de las relaciones de poder entre géneros. La intervención pretende, por una parte, prestar atención especializada e integral a las víctimas de violencia sexual (VVS) en un contexto de falta de acceso a servicios de salud; mientras que por otra, articula una serie de estrategias para perseguir la impunidad generalizada que rodea la comisión de estos delitos y que retroalimenta las condiciones de inequidad y exclusión padecidas por las mujeres. Con el objetivo de avanzar en la superación de la brecha de género, se propone el refuerzo de las capacidades locales para la prevención de la violencia basada en el género y la integralidad de la atención a las víctimas de violencia sexual en Kivu Norte. El primer eje supone la ampliación de la cobertura de los servicios en SSR, incrementando capacidades (RR.HH, infraestructuras, equipamientos e insumos) en 5 Zonas de Salud; así como integrando elementos que confieren mayor integralidad de los servicios (DSR, asesoría de calidad en SSR, atención a familiares, promoción de la salud durante todo el ciclo fértil, etc.) El segundo eje supone el refuerzo del Plan Nacional de Lucha contra el SIDA, ampliando en 6 el número de centros para el diagnóstico, counselling y referenciación para el acceso a tratamiento ARV en la provincia. El tercer eje complementa el resto de estrategias, en la medida que supone el refuerzo de cambios en comportamientos, actitudes y prácticas para la eliminación de condiciones que mantienen la VCM y la impunidad de los agresores.","El proyecto se desarrolla en las localidades de Makpulu, Mabilia y Neisu, en el territorio de Rungu, Haut Huele, Provincia Oriental. La población que atienden estos centros de salud es de 35.164 personas (17.617 mujeres y 17.547 hombres) Esta población vive en situación de extrema pobreza. La problemática de la salud de la mujer en esta zona conjuga varios factores de los que destacamos la casi ausencia de oportunidad de acceso a servicios de salud y una grave carencia en personal de salud cualificado (más bajo aún en el caso de mujeres médicos y enfermeras por tener menor acceso a la formación). En estas circunstancias, la salud de la mujer y del/la niña/a se encuentra particularmente vulnerada por el hecho de los elevados riesgos que la maternidad significa, el excesivo trabajo físico de la mujer en la zona con el consecuente desgaste. La mujer juega un papel fundamental en el sustento de la familia, donde entre otras cosas se tiene que encargar de la recolección de materiales para la construcción de la vivienda familiar. El otro problema que enfrenta este proyecto es la degradación del medio ambiente causada por la forma habitual de construir las viviendas que tiene la población: son viviendas hechas en barro, madera y paja que tienen una duración limitada en el tiempo por la baja calidad y por las termitas que son abundantes en la zona. El concepto de vivienda es de una vivienda provisional que tiene que ser rehecha o abandonada para hacer otra nueva tras un espacio de tiempo. Esto implica estar consumiendo recursos naturales de los bosques de forma constante. Además estas viviendas no son seguras ni cumplen con los mínimos de higiene que deberían tener. El primer campo de la intervención corresponderá pues a las actividades orientadas a incrementar en términos cuantitativos y cualitativos las infraestructuras sanitarias destinadas a la salud materno-infantil y a la salud de la reproducción, así como a la salud de la población en general. En estas se incluyen la construcción de tres maternidades, un puesto de salud y la rehabilitación de un centro de salud. El segundo campo incluye actividades orientadas a mejorar las capacidades de los prestatario/as de estos servicios con la idea de que los efectos redunden no solo en la mejora de los servicios de la salud materna sino también en el potenciamiento del papel de mujer la gestión de los recursos sanitarios. El tercer campo lo ocupan las actividades para implantar un nuevo sistema de construcción de viviendas duraderas respetuoso con el medioambiente que acabaría con el uso masivo de los recursos medioambiental. Entran aquí actividades desde adquisición de nuevas herramientas de la construcción hasta las actividades comunitarias de su difusión. La población podrá ver cómo se construyen estas casas pues se van a construir dos casas para personal enfermero para garantizar así su permanencia en la zona de salud.","Título completo del proyecto: Mejora de la atención en salud sexual-reproductiva y perinatal en las provincias Nord Kivu y Orientale de la República Democrática del Congo, desde una perspectiva comunitaria centrada en la eliminación de todas las formas de violencia de la mujer ::","El proyecto se localiza en los territorios de Beni y Lubero (Kivu Norte, RDC) y pretende fortalecer la coordinación intersectorial para la prevención y atención integral en salud a las Víctimas de Violencia Sexual (VVS), bajo un enfoque de restitución de derechos, desde tres ejes: i)Atención sanitaria integral a VVS: tratamiento médico y psicológico de las VVS y lucha contra la transmisión y feminización del VIH; ii)Fortalecimiento de las capacidades locales de prevención de VBG, VS y VIH; y iii)Apoyo al proceso de reinserción social y restitución de derechos de VVS, asegurando la asistencia legal y el acompañamiento psicosocial a las VVS hasta su completa recuperación, favoreciendo la ejecución de acciones de incidencia ante las autoridades, coordinadas desde la sociedad civil, ganando espacios de representación y participación comunitaria.","Consolidar la calidad en los cuidados de salud de madres y niños de 0 a 5 años en las tres maternidades de Khinsasa, consolidando la estrategia de gestión de prácticas de higiene hospitalaria formando al personal y equipando con materiales de higiene","El proyecto tiene como propósito rehabilitar las condiciones de salud en 12 estructuras sanitarias de la zona de Kamango, provincia de Kivu Norte, con énfasis en la atención a la salud sexual y reproductiva (SSR), la salud materno-infantil y la atención a las víctimas de violencia sexual (VVS), afectadas por la emergencia humanitaria derivada de la ocupación por parte del grupo armado ADF-NALU, y se basa en el desarrollo de tres componentes básicos: dotación de insumos y medicamentos esenciales y específicos, enfatizando el refuerzo de los recursos para la atención de la SSR, salud materno-infantil y atención a VVS; capacitación específica de 24 profesionales y 12 Consejeras comunitarias y la promoción de procesos de empoderamiento comunitario en la prevención de la violencia y la promoción del acceso a la salud desde una perspectiva de género.","El proyecto prevé mejorar el sistema de salud en Bandundu Ville y los hábitos saludables de las comunas de Bosoko, Disai y Mayoyo, a través de tres ejes de intervención: - Mejora de las instalaciones de saneamiento y los sistemas de esterilización y limpieza de los centros sanitarios (un Hospital General, un Hospital Secundario y un Centro de salud) de las comunidades de Bosoko, Disai y Mayoyo. Con ello aumentarán las prácticas de prevención y disminuiran las enfermedades de transmisión fecal-oral y de origen hídricas dentro de los centros sanitarios. - Puesta en marcha de un sistema de buena gestión de residuos, esterilización y limpieza, lo que contribuirá asimismo a una mejor prevención de infecciones intrahospitalarias. - Promoción de la salud y aumento de la prevención de enfermedades hídricas y relacionadas con la falta de higiene. La propuesta pretende ser una respuesta integral a las necesidades de salud de las tres comunas con especial énfasis en la situación y la participación de la mujer.","Disminuir la tasa de enfermedades de la ciudad de Kimpese causadas por la contaminación ambiental.

En concreto, se reforzarán las capacidades de 600 hogares en materia de seguridad alimentaria y producción agrícola, mejorando las prácticas higiénicas básicas a nivel comunitario. La propuesta se integra en una estrategia más amplia de desarrollo rural que Cruz Roja y Cruz Roja Congo han puesto en marcha en la región de Bandundu, y cuyo objetivo es apoyar el desarrollo agrícola integran con un enfoque de género que equilibre la posición de las mujeres en relación al acceso y control de los recursos productivos.","El proyecto pretende hacer frente a los problemas obstétrico y ginecológicos de 28.288 mujeres residentes en el secto de Ciyamba (centro-sur de R.D. Congo), a través de la prevención (educación de mujeres, parteras y creación de una unidad móvil para atención primaria) y de atención médica especializada con la creación de una unidad ginecológica en el centro hospitalario Julia Blasco de Mpyana.","El proyecto se localiza en Kivu Norte (RDC). El desastre humanitario que vive la zona es la principal causa de la pobreza, las instalaciones sanitarias son insuficientes y el conflicto armado las ha dejado en un estado deplorable que no permite ofrecer servicios de calidad mínima, por la falta de equipamiento para establecer diagnósticos, atender y realizar intervenciones quirúrgicas. El proyecto parte de la base de que la salud es un derecho fundamental y un requisito imprescindible para avanzar hacia el desarrollo, y se enmarca en la línea estratégica de salud del socio local, Cáritas Goma, que tiene como fin mejorar la atención sanitaria a la población más vulnerable de Goma, con especial énfasis en la salud materno-infantil. Para ello se equiparán los nuevos bloques de maternidad, cirugía, hospitalización y consultas externas del Hospital General de Referencia ?Charité Maternelle? de Goma.","El proyecto consiste en la dotación e instalación de un equipo electrógeno que permita una adecuada atención de las personas atendidas en el Centro de Salud Mental ?Telema?.","The programme outputs are:1) Strengthened capacity of national and sub-national authorities to plan, implement and monitor the National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women (NSPAW) 2013-2022 and policy documents developed relating to Women´s Human Rights  (WHR), including SRHR, Violence Against Womwn (VAW) and Women in emergencies/ SCR 1325.2) Enhanced Community endorsement of SRHR and gender equality in UNFPA supported Project areas.3) Increased referrals of GBV survivors to information, services and justice in Kachin, Northern Shan State and Rakhine. 4) Strengthened empowerment of women and girls in UNFPA supported project areas through increased awareness of women's human rights and Community-based services responsive to women's needs and rights.The outputs will lead to the outcome: * Policies responsive to the needs of women and girls regarding sexual Health and irghts, the right to safety from violence and safety in emergencies, are adopted and implemented, in line with international norms and standards and informed by the voices of women and girls.* Increased access of women and girls to comprehensive, rights-based package of SRH and GBV services i Kachin, Northern Shan State and Rakhine.","El proyecto tiene como objetivo reducir la mortalidad materna e infantil en el momento del parto y para ello se formará 50 mujeres de Kivu Norte que ya vienen ejerciendo la profesión de forma tradicional y se les dotará de material necesario para sus intervenciones a fin de que ofrezcan una atención más segura en los partos a domicilio","Los pigmeos son los más antiguos pobladores de África Central. A pesar de esto padecen una situación de discriminación por parte de los demás pueblos que han ido colonizando sus tierras. Semi-nómadas, los pigmeos son recolectores y cazadores. Nuestro proyecto está destinado principalmente a unas 3500 personas (1800 mujeres) de etnia pigmea mbuti del territorio de Bayenga (17,64% de la población de la zona). Los problemas que padecen se resumen en: -peligro de extinción como etnia por la privación del acceso a sus tierras ancestrales por las explotaciones de madera y minerales, por la extensión de la agricultura en zonas de selva, por la cercanía del parque natural del okapi (territorio del que fueron expulsados) y por los conflictos bélicos. -en su seminomadismo son más vulnerables a enfermedades parasitarias e infecciosas y su acceso al sistema público de sanidad y de vacunaciones es difícil y reducido. La mortalidad infantil ronda el 45%, y la media de vida es entre 40-45 años. La tasa de crecimiento de la población es casi nula. -peligro de asimilación cultural total con el pueblo bantú al estar orientada la educación hacía eso. -con un índice de analfabetismo del 95%, el pueblo pigmeo está sometido al patronazgo de la mayoría bantú a través del poder del miedo, de la superstición, de la ignorancia. La situación del pueblo pigmeo mbuti es en sí misma una situación de crisis humanitaria pues si no se se actúa rápidamente está llamado a desaparecer. En un primer momento nos planteamos una rápida intervención para frenar el avance de la lepra y la tuberculosis, y diagnosticar todos los posibles casos. Para esto se realizarán campañas de salud para los 33 campamentos pigmeos del territorio de Bayenga. A la vez y de forma transversal se aprovechará esta intervención para fortalecer al pueblo pigmeo en la toma de conciencia de su identidad como minoría étnica, en la necesidad de defender sus derechos y su territorio. También se trabajarán estas ideas con la población bantú para propiciar un cambio de mentalidad en relación al pigmeo al que considera su esclavo. Nos proponemos reforzar a los servicios de salud del Estado para mejorar sus capacidades en la atención de estas enfermedades (esto beneficiará también a la población bantú), y no menos importante, ayudar a inducir un cambio en lo que se refiere al derecho al acceso a la salud de la población pigmea, cambiando la mentalidad existente que los considera una raza inferior y los excluye de la asistencia sanitaria. También se beneficiarán del proyecto 15000 (6500 hombres/9500 mujeres) habitantes bantúes de Bayenga que serán sensibilizadas sobre la prevención de la lepra y la tuberculosis. Así como el personal sanitario capacitado (14 hombres y 9 mujeres). Vamos a realizar materiales audiovisuales sobre la situación de la población pigmea que nos sirvan para denunciar esta crisis y concientizar a la población de la RD Congo y al a propia población pigmea sobre sus derechos.","Pabellón de pacientes con enfermedades contagiosas, Kivi sur.

Samarbetsorganisationerna och rättighetsbärare inom utvalda målgrupper ska stärka sin kapacitet bl.a. för att bedriva påverkansarbete och utkräva sina rättigheter inom specifika tematiska områden. Deltagande är centralt.Urvalet av insatsmål har gjorts från länder i olika regioner i syfte att ge en bild av resultaten inom några av de vanligast återkommande ämnesområdena. Medvetet har insatsmål av varierande konkretionsnivå valts för att visa på skillnaderna mellan länderna. Sidas bedömning är att resultatramverket försvagas av att övergripande tematiska mål saknas. Målen i resultatregistret återges som de är formulerade i resultatramverket på engelska.","OPCs förändringsteori utgår från att samhällen förändras i en demokratisk riktning genom folkligt deltagande. OPC har utvecklat sin resultatmatris med utvecklingsmål på programnivå i respektive program-, projektland och de två tematiska programmen. Varje program bygger på målsättningar i syfte att stärka den samlade effekten av OPCs utvecklingssamarbete och för att möjliggöra uppföljning av resultat. Programländernas interventionslogik skiljer sig från projektländer och de tematiska programmen såtillvida att det inom programländer finns ett långsiktigt utvecklingsmål, ett programmål med olika delmål och till dessa utgångsvärden och indikatorer. Det saknas dock utgångsvärden i flera av delmålen. I projektländerna har vissa projekt endast angivits på ett övergripande sätt med angivet projektmål och samarbetsorganisation. Sammantaget ska insatserna leda till det övergripande målet genom att stärka folkligt deltagande och organisering för gemensamt påverkansarbete.  Inom t ex programlandet Filippinerna är det långsiktiga utvecklingsmålet att filippinska arbetare och marginaliserade grupper på Mindanao genom förbättrad organisering har stärkt sin röst och bidragit till en demokratisk utveckling på Filippinerna. Programmålet som anges: Filippinska arbetare och marginaliserade grupper på Mindanao har stärkt sin förmåga att tillvarata sina intressen och har ökat inflytande över sin situation. Genom att nya kollektivavtal tecknas antas att arbetares situation stärks. OPCs program på Filippinerna stärker arbetare och marginaliserade grupper genom att fokusera på deras rätt till organisering och väntas leda till ökat inflytande på såväl mikro- som makronivå. Inom exempelvis projektlandet Pakistan har OPC valt att samarbeta med pakistanska organisationer som har fredlig samvaro som en del av sina visioner, bedriver religiöst obundet arbete och är öppet kritiska till den religiösa, fundamentalistiska tendenserna. Ett av projektmålen är att kvinnor ska kunna, genom studiecirklar, utbildningar, erfarenhetsutbyte och kampanjer, både inom den formella och inom den informella sektorn, öka sitt fackliga och politiska engagemang.  Inom det tematiska Särskilda programmet har civilsamhällesorganisationer och grupper en särskild viktig roll att främja demokratisering och organisering av människor som vill förändra sitt samhälle. Syftet är att stärka förändringsaktörer i sex länder genom ökad kunskap i demokrati- och rättighetsfrågor och organisering. Sida kommer att följa upp OPCs resultatramverk i sin helhet, men har specifikt också valt ut tre insatsmål som syns i resultatregistret för att de anses representera utvalda målgrupper för OPCs program utifrån perspektiven ansvarsutkrävande, icke-diskriminering och facklig organisering. För mål två noterar Sida att detta insatsmål är av långsiktig natur. Sida bedömer att interventionslogiken är klar och att den kommer att bidra till att uppnå det övergripande insatsmålet.","We Effect frame agreement, Sida/CIVSAM, 2014-2016 and 2017","Framework agreement with Individuell Människohjälp during the period 2015-2017 within the strategy for support via Swedish civil society organisations","Plan Sweden's 3,5-year program for child rights is planned to be implemented in 19 country programs, four regional programs and one global advocacy and innovation program.

The relevance of this collaboration project for Appendix c1 lies in the potential to develop novel drugs against anxiety in view of the disproportionate increase in violence in low and middleincome countries especially affecting their most exposed individuals.","Dengue fever, a viral infected disease transmitted by mosquitoes (vector), is a major public health challenge in Malaysia despite the fact that concerted surveillance and control efforts are in place. An early warning with precise forecast of outbreak allows timely decision-making and mitigation. Such epidemic prediction capability is not demonstrated in current surveillance system. In early 2014, researchers from Umea University have initiated a multidisciplinary and multinational collaboration for the development of a dengue early warning system for Singapore and Malaysia. Umeå researchers possess substantial experience in disease forecasting modeling using various statistical and mathematical techniques. This project promotes research capacity and expertise required for disease forecast. Activities such as workshops, seminars and visits to Disease Control Division are planned to facilitate exchange or transfer of knowledge or ideas and develop strategies for studies including forecast of dengue, development of early warning system, economic evaluation and information distribution. Subsequently, knowledge and experience gained will be translated as course modules for graduate students in the University of Malaya. Anticipated outcomes include long-term research partnership and advance knowledge of disease early warning that may contribute to reducing burden of dengue and promote healthy living and wellbeing in the community.","The research project will be driven by merging the expertise on biosensors fabrication based on high throughput printing technology (Linköping University, Sweden), and quartz micro-balance (QCM) and microfluidics technology (International Islamic University, Malaysia) for the development of Micro Total Analysis System (µTAS) for point-of-care detection of dengue fever. The QCM-µTAS offers an ultrasensitive, cost-effective and mobile platform for the development of distributed biosensors for decentralization health care management and control of dengue in low and middle-income countries, where the access to resources and infrastructure is limited. The latest figures from Malaysia health authority shows a dramatic four times increase in dengue cases reported and with a triple increase in the number of deaths caused by dengue in the first quarter of 2014. This is a global threat not only limited to the citizens living in dengue hot spot countries, also to billions of international travelers travelling to the tropical countries. The Dengue-Screen test is expected to improve the health care management of dengue by providing rapid, mobile and cost effective diagnostics tools. Together with the scientific goal, the Dengue-Screen project also strengthens the collaboration between the involved Universities in the vision of exchange of researcher, knowledge and support future joint applications to larger national and international funding for long term collaboration.","Los objetivos han sido cumplimentar los protocolos de mantenimiento de los equipos biomédicos del centro hospitalario y hacer una planificación con un horario de mantenimiento de cada uno.

The project has been completed and the landfill is in operation since 2011. Due to the poor location of the landfill site, and risk for landslides, PUC Duboko urgently needs to stabilize and extend the landfill in order to continue its operations. A new major landslide is likely to put an end to PUC Duboko operations for some time to come. It would probably also cause serious pollution of the Turkish creek, which runs close to the landfill area.The proposed new Duboko sustainability project aims to provide additional disposal capacity of minimum 2.5 years, increase the stability of the landfill to minimize the risk for new landslides and, through technical assistance, improve the operational performance of PUC Duboko and support the Ministry’s development of a realistic municipal solid waste investment pipeline.The stabilization and extension of the landfill site would consist of disposal directly below and to the south of the current site. This would not only provide more space for landfilling but also stabilize the whole site, allowing for disposal on the higher etages 4 and 5, which is not possible today (due to the risk of land slide). In total it would allow a minimum of 2.5 years of additional disposal capacity and there is space on the south side to continue disposal for approximately 25 years (that will be done at a later stage, I e not supported by this project).Through the Swedish supported Environmental Infrastructure Support Program (EISP), support has already started to strengthen the operational, managerial and financial aspects of PUC Duboko's services and have also supported the initial technical preparations for the new construction. The support from EISP will contine, with already decided funding, and will provide complimentary work to the actual construction work which will be managed by EBRD. Sida has channeled funds through EBRD for the earlier support to Duboko and consider this the most feasible option also for the extension considering the urgency and need for immediate action.","The project will establish a project preparation facility located at the Ministry of environment with the aim to further develop the Serbian project pipeline.

It is a procurement of an external audit of the Sida-supported program for research and higher education at the University of Rwanda (UR) and its predecessor, the National University of Rwanda (NUR).

Howver, it recently became known that the procurements for both periods had disappeared from the UR procurement list in connection with the merger of the NUR with the other six public higher education institutions to form the UR. If UR will now do the procurement the audit will be carried out at the earliest in November with the final report probably in December.

Esta enfermedad tropical, a lo largo de la historia ha inducido cambios socioculturales y obligado a la elaboración de estrategias políticas, económicas, educativas y sanitarias para responder a este flagelo. La enfermedad ha sido abordada desde la biología, de la ecología, y de aproximaciones socioculturales en las que se relaciona el comportamiento humano con la transmisión de la enfermedad basándose en la articulación entre lo macro y microsociológico, es decir, en el estudio de creencias y lógicas sociales. A pesar de los grandes esfuerzos para combatir este problema de salud pública, en países con alto grado de pobreza y en situación de vulnerabilidad como Colombia, los índices de morbilidad y mortalidad no han disminuido sustancialmente. Uno de los principales retos a los que se enfrenta el país son las barreras de comunicación interpersonal en la atención en salud, debido a la diversidad lingüística y cultural de las poblaciones que atiende. En estos espacios de interacción social, ?la comunicación a través del lenguaje? cumple un gran papel, pues de este depende en gran medida la capacidad que tenga cada una de las personas para comprender lo que expresa el otro, y ser comprendido; en este caso el personal de salud y las personas que consultan (pacientes).

Todos ellos tienen datos favorables en desigualdad humana, desigualdad de género, desarrollo de género y pobreza multidimensional. Sin embargo, y en cuanto a los datos de VIH/SIDA, en 2014 se contabilizaron unos 16.500 casos de SIDA en Cuba, lo que representa el 83,3% de los 19.781 casos diagnosticados desde 1986 hasta 2013. Además, se insiste en que la epidemia está presente en Cuba y afecta a adultos en edad sexualmente activa que tienen relaciones desprotegidas. El hecho de que la mayor forma de contagio siga siendo las relaciones sexuales desprotegidas nos vislumbra un horizonte de falta de concienciación y educación, lo que reafirma que la información no es suficiente cuando hablamos de cambio de conductas y conciencia, por lo que es imprescindible formar y empoderar a la población. Nuestro objetivo general es contribuir al desarrollo y la calidad de vida de las personas, construyendo un cuadro de la problemática comunitaria de estos sujetos para identificar posibles situaciones de riesgo y desarrollar pautas de intervención para promover una mayor calidad de vida, prevenir y, en su caso, mejorar situaciones problemáticas de estos sujetos. En este sentido, para contribuir a la prevención de la infección es necesario Establecer las bases para el desarrollo institucional de la ENSAP y mejora comunitaria de la calidad de vida, la promoción de la salud y VIH/sida en Cuba. Para lograr este objetivo nos planteamos, en primer lugar, desarrollar un proyecto conjunto de investigación científica para explorar los conocimientos, percepciones y prácticas de riesgo del VIH/sida de los grupos vulnerables en Cuba y plantear líneas de acción futuras. En segundo lugar, pretendemos desarrollar un intercambio de profesionales y académicos, capacitándoles a nivel de postgrado y formación permanente, en el ámbito de la investigación e intervención en educación para la salud, por medio de cursos, seminarios, etc. También pretendemos difundir los conocimientos a través de encuentros, seminarios y/o congresos de formación donde se divulgue y sensibilice a la población ante las prácticas sexuales seguras y responsables. Y, por último, contribuir al mundo científico a través de varias publicaciones sobre los resultados de nuestro estudio, tanto a nivel nacional como internacional. Los destinatarios directos son los docentes e investigadores de la Escuela Nacional de Salud Pública y los grupos vulnerables (ya mencionados anteriormente) y la población en general. Entre los resultados esperados, se encuentran: 20 profesionales formados en intervención e investigación Educación para la Salud y VIH/sida, 100 agentes comunitarios formados en prevención de VIH/sida en el ámbito comunitario, elaboración de materiales didácticos de formación e información con enfoque de género, difusión de los resultados de la investigación en eventos científicos y publicaciones especializadas nacional e internacional. Consideramos que el proyecto es Pertinente (aclara un problema y se ha realizado un profundo trabajo de documentación y revisión del estado de la investigación), y Verificable (lo que se propone es observable e investigable). También es altamente viable por varias razones que enumeramos a continuación: - En primer lugar, nace de un análisis de la realidad realizado en el terreno y consensuado con la contraparte, tanto en el diseño de proyecto y acciones como los objetivos, duración, etc. - En segundo lugar, el proyecto es sostenible porque crea un reforzamiento de capacidades en la contraparte. - En tercer, por la capacidad, experiencia y solvencia tanto de las instituciones que intervienen en primer nivel (UPO-ENSAP), así como de las instituciones públicas colaboradoras y que participan como grupo de expertos. - En cuarto lugar, por el impacto que va a generar en la población a través de la transferencia de los resultados. Por último, tendrá un alto impacto en el mundo científico, al divulgar los logros alcanzados en editoriales y revistas de impacto, así como por la buena acogida y resultados de los proyectos de cooperación internacional al desarrollo que, en colaboración con la AACID, hemos venido desarrollando a lo largo de varios años en otros países. Este proyecto se alinea y es coherente con las políticas públicas andaluzas en el marco de los derechos humanos, siendo Cuba uno de los países prioritarios para la cooperación así como las dos principales líneas de trabajo en las que sustentan las actividades: educación y salud. De esta manera, respondemos a las prioridades sectoriales de la Ley 14/2003, de 22 de Diciembre, de Cooperación Internacional para el Desarrollo (servicios sociales básicos) y a los objetivos específicos del PACODE (2015-2018) y sus líneas estratégicas de trabajo que constituyen la referencia para las actuaciones a desarrollar en cada ámbito (O1 LP 4; O4 LP 2 y O5 LP 1 y 2).","La presente propuesta tiene como objetivo general: Contribuir a la implementación de metodologías biofarmacéuticas optimizadas y validadas para la obtención y desarrollo de medicamentos transdérmicos más eficaces y seguros, promoviendo a su vez una formación de avanzada en los profesionales farmacéuticos de la universidad local, de su industria farmacéutica y de su organismo regulatorio.","The consortium will provide emergency health and nutrition services to drought affected communities in 69 districts across 17 regions of Somalia/Somaliland.","Through an integrated approach, AAH, UNICEF and WFP will address the basic nutritional needs and strengthen the food security of vulnerable populations in a selected number of LGAs in Borno and Yobe.

Todos ellos tienen datos favorables en desigualdad humana, desigualdad de género, desarrollo de género y pobreza multidimensional. Sin embargo, y en cuanto a los datos de VIH/SIDA, en 2014 se contabilizaron unos 16.500 casos de SIDA en Cuba, lo que representa el 83,3% de los 19.781 casos diagnosticados desde 1986 hasta 2013. Además, se insiste en que la epidemia está presente en Cuba y afecta a adultos en edad sexualmente activa que tienen relaciones desprotegidas. El hecho de que la mayor forma de contagio siga siendo las relaciones sexuales desprotegidas nos vislumbra un horizonte de falta de concienciación y educación, lo que reafirma que la información no es suficiente cuando hablamos de conductas y conciencia, por lo que es imprescindible formar y empoderar a la población. Nuestro objetivo general es contribuir al desarrollo y la calidad de vida de las personas, construyendo un cuadro de la problemática comunitaria de estos sujetos para identificar posibles situaciones de riesgo y desarrollar pautas de intervención para promover una mayor calidad de vida, prevenir y, en su caso, mejorar situaciones problemáticas de estos sujetos. En este sentido, para contribuir a la prevención de la infección es necesario establecer las bases para el desarrollo institucional de la ENSAP y mejora comunitaria de la calidad de vida, la promoción de la salud y VIH/sida en Cuba. Para lograr este objetivo nos planteamos, en primer lugar, desarrollar un proyecto conjunto de investigación científica para explorar los conocimientos, percepciones y prácticas de riesgo del VIH/sida de los grupos vulnerables en Cuba y plantear líneas de acción futuras. En segundo lugar, pretendemos desarrollar un intercambio de profesionales y académicos, capacitándoles a nivel de postgrado y formación permanente, en el ámbito de la investigación e intervención en educación para la salud, por medio de cursos, seminarios, etc. También pretendemos difundir los conocimientos a través de encuentros, seminarios y/o congresos de formación donde se divulgue y sensibilice a la población ante las prácticas sexuales seguras y responsables. Y, por último, contribuir al mundo científico a través de varias publicaciones sobre los resultados de nuestro estudio, tanto a nivel nacional como internacional.","Title: Intergrated Community Case Management Programme (ICCM2) - Health Service Delivery","Title: Integrated Community Case Management Programme Phase 2 (ICCM 2) - Monitoring and Evaluation","Title: Save Procurement through AECOM","Title: Procurement of medicines and medical equipment supplies for Tristan da Cunha","Title: Support to  Malaria Behaviour Change Communication","Title: Support to Zanzibar Mass Distribution of Bed nets","Title: Support to Tanzania mainland Mass Distribution of Bed Nets","The project aims to provide an improved solid waste management (SWM) system in Tashkent, the capital city, to upgrade urban infrastructure and services.

With 80 million people it has the second largest population in Africa. According to the SRH strategy (2007-2015) young people (10–24) are making up almost one third of the total population heavily pressuring the demand for health services, education and employment (FMoH, 2008). Needs in the area of SRHR are very high in Ethiopia. The maternal mortality ratio remains as high as 676 per 100,000 live births (EDHS, 2011). The lifetime risk of a woman dying during pregnancy or childbirth is at 1 in 52, compared to 1 in 10,000 in developed countries (data.worldbank.org).

The objective is to implement a specifically designed model (the SPEND model) for health care provision in high discrimination settings and to test and evaluate its efficacy with regard to reduced rates of sexually transmitted infections and HIV and improved treatment access among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Tanzania. Our previous research from this population indicates high levels of HIV/Chlamydia (30%/19%) and transactional sex (30%), low frequency of condom-use (24,5) and discrimination being a barrier for accessing HIV testing services (14,8%). Due to stigma, many MSM turned directly to pharmacists to purchase STI treatment, which resulted in inappropriate diagnoses and treatments. Unique data on increasing HIV/health care for MSM and reducing discrimination will be collected through assessing the impact of provision of access to safe testing and treatment; training pharmacists and drugstores as front-line providers of STI treatment; provision of human sexuality education to health care providers and nursing students to reduce homophobia within health care; and use of patient navigators for MSM with HIV disease in treatment. The findings generated by this project will be used to inform future research and interventions, which address the health of MSM, and other vulnerable groups, in highly discriminatory settings.","Multiresistant bacteria are a fastly growing world-wide threat to human health. These resistant bacteria may easily spread between patients in the hospital setting in the absence of proper hygiene. Escherichia coli, present in the normal human gut, may produce enzymes called Extended Spectrum â-Lactamases (ESBL) or carbapenemases, which degrade penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems, respectively. There is no study in Africa, including Tanzania, investigating the risk to acquire ESBL- or carbapenemas-producing E. coli during hospital stay. We will investigate this risk for patients in the pediatric and gynecological units at a hospital in the Moshi area, Tanzania. The prevalence of colonization in faeces will be related to antibiotic use and possible contamination of the hospital environment with these bacteria. For comparison colonization of patients in the outpatient setting will be investigated as well. The prevalence of the globally present O25b-ST131 clone said to be largely responsible for the spread of ESBL will be determined as will the genotypes of ESBL- and carbapenemas-producing strains to elucidate possible transmission routes. The results will be used to increase the local knowledge of basic hygiene routines and their implementation in daily hospital care in order to decrease the spread of multiresistant bacteria between patients. The study will also increase the competence at the local microbiological laboratory in diagnosing resistant bacteria.","The main objective of this project is to create the reciprocal scientific research collaboration between the Tanzanian and Swedish research groups by improving research and training in the area of natural products chemistry and related fields to international standards. Hence, this mutual collaborative research will focus on searching and developing anti-TB agents from plants surrounding the hot springs in Tanzania.","Formación en Neurofisiología de la Visión en el Cerebro en las universidades de Guayaquil y de Babahoyo.

La ayuda alimentaria que reciben 35.562 personas muy vulnerables, según ACNUR, de El Aaiún (60% mujeres) no cubre el 100% de sus necesidades (2100 calorías/día). Los alimentos siguen siendo una prioridad perentoria en los campos de refugiados saharauis enfatizada por la crisis, según la MLRS, al reducirse la ayuda bilateral que complementaba la de los grandes donantes. La última Encuesta Nutricional (ACNUR 2012) sitúa los indicadores de inseguridad alimentaria en los hogares de El Aaiún fuera de niveles aceptables en un 40,8% (36% limítrofe y 4,8% pobre) y califica como problema muy grave la anemia que padece un 41,9% de su mujeres en edad reproductiva (15 a 49 años), severa en el 3,9% de los casos. La encuesta relaciona la malnutrición aguda y la carencia de micronutrientes de las mujeres, asociadas al riesgo de mayor morbilidad y mortalidad, a la que padecen sus hijos e hijas. Afecta concretamente al 30,2% de menores de 6 a 59 meses de El Aaiún, estando el 23,8% por debajo de la talla (6,7% baja talla severa). Siguiendo también las recomendaciones de la Mesa de Coordinación Alimentaria, de mejorar la insuficiente canasta básica con productos frescos, y tras decisión de las beneficiarias en unas jornadas participativas; se les suministrará a lo largo de diez meses 250 ml. diarios de leche de camella adquirida en el mercado local. Esta leche es rica en vitaminas B y C, más baja en grasa que la de vaca, más alta en potasio, posee 10 veces más hierro, contiene insulina natural, ácido fólico y componentes contra los patógenos que causan intolerancias a la lactosa, alergias e infecciones en general. Este proyecto se vincula a la búsqueda de alternativas de impacto para la mejora de la deficitaria salud de las mujeres refugiadas, a raíz de una positiva experiencia piloto desarrollada en Dajla en 2012. Incorpora las lecciones aprendidas, el saber de las mujeres y su capacidad para impulsar su propio desarrollo; incidiendo en los recursos culturales, la oferta del mercado local y la sensibilización en las propiedades curativas de la leche de camella como acción preventiva. Las capacidades locales para abordar la problemática se fortalecerán con este aprendizaje comparado, contrastado de forma científica por un estudio de 60 casos realizado con el Ministerio de Salud y la Comisión Sanitaria de Sevilla (chequeo a los 0, 6 y 12 meses, incluyendo test de hierro). Como parte de esta estrategia apoyada en lo local, se adquirirá además un rebaño de 32 camellas y 1 macho, que suministrará de 11 a 15.000 litros de leche al programa, para mejorar la soberanía alimentaria de la wilaya.","Título completo del proyecto: Apoyo nutricional en las escuelas nómadas del Sahara Occidental.

Antimalarial and antimicrobial drugs constitute the routine treatment basis, but the role of supportive therapies, involving the maintenance of a normal glucose and electrolyte balance, has been given limited attention. While hyperglycemia is the most common blood glucose anomaly seen in infectious disease patients in high-income settings, hypoglycemia is not uncommon in low-income settings. 1.8-7.3% of children admitted with fever present with hypoglycemia, a known predictor of poor clinical outcome. A number of studies also indicate an increased mortality among children with blood glucose levels that are currently considered within the normal range, e.g. 2.5 - 5.0 mmol/l, compared to children with higher blood glucose levels (>5.0mmol/l). This randomized clinical trial will evaluate the benefit of glucose administration already ay blood glucose levels<5.0mmol/l in children presenting to a Ugandan hospital with an acute febrile illness. It will further explain the metabolic response, through the measurement of metabolic markers, in pediatric acute infections and how this influences the final outcome in children with hypo-, normo- and hyperglycemia. Our results will highlight the potential need to revise current hypoglycemia cut off values in order to increase child survival in acute infections.","Rosetting is a virulent parasite phenotype associated with the occurrence of severe malaria, but what is its biological function to the parasite, why does it exist? We here suggest that rosetting enhances the invasion of the parasite into attached- rosetting- erythrocytes since we have found associations between the multiplication rate of the parasites, rosetting and peripheral parasitemia of Ugandan malaria patients. We were however not able to prove this at the molecular level with in vitro propagated strains using antibodies to the identified ligands. As a consequence we suggest to explore freshly isolated parasites (including merozoites) in detail, identify the red blood receptors used, ligands as well as serum proteins employed by the parasite at the level of the merozoite as well as the iRBC. Aims Aim 1. Isolate parasites of patients with different invasion characteristics Aim 2. Determine involved parasite ligands and receptors Aim 3. Understand merozoite invasion as a function of rosetting The purpose of the suggested work is to explore in what way Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte rosetting enhances parasite invasion to initiate severe malaria. In an extended purpose we also aim to further the capacity for research in Uganda through the eduction of PhD students and post-docs, writing and presenting publications as well as the running of courses. Further, this will generate knowledge essential for the populations exposed to malaria.","Malaria kills almost one million people every year. The symptoms include fever, anemia and sometimes death. P. falciparum is the parasite that is responsible for most of the deaths. It is a major contribution to children?s high morbidity and mortality in countries like Uganda. There is no vaccine and resistance against medications is an increasing problem. The parasites live inside erythrocytes where they multiply, and every 48 hours new mini-parasites, so called merozoites, exit the bursting old erythrocytes and enter new erythrocytes. We want to study the process of invasion into new erythrocytes. If we know exactly which proteins the merozoites bind to, we can use this in creating a vaccine or in forming new drugs. We will use combinations of parasites with defined invasion pathways or merozoite antigen knock-out parasites together with erythrocytes that lack specific antigens on their surface, or antibodies against these antigens. We will combine our own expertise of malaria with our collaborator?s expertise in erythrocyte variants, and we believe that this can create totally new opportunities to find new ways of invasion for the P. falciparum parasites. This knowledge is urgently needed to be able to make a vaccine against malaria.","In Uganda 2% of mothers have uninterrupted skin-to-skin contacts (SSC) with their infant after birth, 83% of infants have hypothermia which is one of the leading causes of mortality in newborns and the rate of exclusively breastfeeding at 1 month is 57%.

We will study if a simple low-cost intervention that can enhance early initiation and duration of breastfeeding can be implemented. The medical staff and the hospital management will be shown a DVD containing information about newborns´ instinctive behavior and the benefits of SSC and this information will also be spread in pamphlets and posters. A quasi-experimental design will be used with data collections before and after the intervention. 60 mother-infant pairs will be included in each of the 2 data collections. SSC and breastfeeding will be observed and the temperature of the infant will be measured. 1 month after birth the mothers will be interviewed about breastfeeding and interpretation of their infant´s cues. Focus group interviews will be performed with the staff to investigate what they perceive as facilitating factors and barriers to implement SSC. If proven effective the intervention can be implemented in other low resource settings.

The embassy judges the intervention to be relevant and that it will contribute to the Swedish development cooperation strategy for Uganda, result area 3: Improved basic health and, more specifically, the objectives 1) improved access to high quality child and maternal care, and 2) Improved access to sexual and reproductive health and rights for women and men, girls and boys. Links between SRHR and women´s autonomy and empowerment are well documented, starting with a person´s right to decide over her/his body. The focus of the project in this field will hence move beyond the mere health aspect of reproductive health and into the democracy/right aspect of women´s empowerment. The preventive aspect of SRHR will also address the need to decrease strain on the overburdened health sector in Uganda as well as its spiralling population growth.The sexual and reproductive health situation in Uganda is a mixed picture, with wide variations in achievements in across the country in access to and use of services such as facility-based delivery and modern contraceptive use (ranging from 7 per cent in Karamoja to 40 per cent in Kampala). Teenage pregnancy rates, unsafe abortions and rising HIV rates are of particular concern. Inadequacies in the health system to address the SRH/HIV situation include a shortage of human resources for health with 1,400 vacant posts for midwives, suboptimal emergency obstetric care services, stock outs of essential drugs, and poor infrastructure. Socio-cultural, economic factors and gender inequality deter access to services by rural communities particularly adolescents, and other marginalized groups. Poorly coordinated community mobilization and engagement coupled with inadequate male involvement in health restrict women and young people from utilizing available services.Given the above, UNFPA has designed an intervention to increase availability and use of rights-based, integrated SRH services that meet standards of quality of care and equity in access for women, young people, sex workers and LGBT persons in 10 high-need districts in post-conflict areas of Uganda (plus 4 HIV hubs). The strategic objectives of the intervention are 1) To strengthen the capacity of the health system to deliver rights-based Reproductive, Maternal, New-born and Adolescent Health services to high maternal mortality burdened regions of the country; and 2) To mobilize institutional structures including community, religious and cultural leadership for increased utilization of stigma-free SRH/HIV services.The intervention will build on previous support to UNFPA from the embassy, which was conducted in eight districts for reproductive health and rights and five other districts for HIV/AIDS activities (51180038: Support to UNFPA to improve maternal health services in Uganda 2011-12, Kamp 22/2011 and 51180046: Decision on contribution to UNFPA, Strengthening Capacity for Quality Maternal Health Services, Youth Friendly and HIV Protection, Kamp 12/2013). This intervention expands and concentrates lessons learned in the previous support to a geographic area that is particularly disadvantaged compared to the rest of the country. The embassy sees this as an advantage for two reasons. First, the 10 districts that have been chosen for the current intervention are concentrated to Northern and North-eastern Uganda, which are “post-conflict” areas. The support can thus be seen as helping bring these provinces up to the same level as the rest of the country. Secondly, the chosen districts also overlap with the seven districts where the embassy is preparing to support UNICEF during the same period. The advantage of this is that the two agencies, with different but complementary mandates, will thus be able to help the coinciding 7 post-conflict districts t","Support to maternal and child health in Karamoja.","UNHCO was founded in 1999 to promote full integration and implementation of the rights based approach in Uganda´s health sector through meaningful citizen-duty bearer engagement in healthcare planning and delivery. Since 2003, UNHCO has functioned as the secretariat for a coalition of 25 Civil Society Organisations called the Voices for Health Rights (VHR). VHR is a group of health rights advocacy NGOs from diverse health thematic areas of focus. In 2010 a sub-coalition of the VHR, consisting of eight of the VHR NGOs, formed to implement the Maternal Health Project (MHP). The initial selection of partners from VHR to become IPs was based on a system review that took into consideration organizational capacity and cost-efficiency.A proposal was submitted to Sweden for a five-year support. Building on the previous financial support by Sweden to the project, a new project proposal has been submitted for an additional five year support, in what is called a phase II, 2015-2019. The working title of the project is: “Improving Maternal, Sexual and Reproductive Health through the Rights-Based Approach among rural communities in Uganda”. The goal for the MHP phase II is “To contribute to reduction of maternal and new born mortality in Uganda” and its purpose is “To improve demand and utilisation of maternal, sexual, reproductive and new born health services at community level through the rights-based approach”.Health is a resource strained public sector in Uganda. Focus has been to supply services, while little resources have been put into quality assuring services. Yet, it is the quality assurance that ensures that services can be, and are, used. The resource constraint spills over into weak and often incomplete service delivery chains. The MDG that has progressed least in Uganda is the MDG 5. Progress to fulfil MDG 5 is ultimately a combination of sexuality rights and a health system chain that can ensure safe pregnancies through to deliveries. In light of a stagnant maternal mortality indicator in Uganda, the MHP was formed to create demand for accountability of delivering quality and equity health services in a transparent manner followed by promotion of access to, and utilization of, maternal health services. In general terms the project will use a right based approach to programming to build capacity amongst potential maternal health service users to demand for quality services. In order to fulfil the project goal and purpose, there are four project result areas identified for the MHP:•\tCommunities aware of their rights and demand quality comprehensive MSRH services.•\tCommunities have good access to and high utilization of comprehensive MSRH services.•\tKey duty bearers held accountable for delivery of comprehensive MSRH services.•\tIPs and Secretariat have capacity to effectively implement MHP and mainstream comprehensive MSRHR.A baseline will be established during the first part of phase II for the new SRHR indicators. On a general note, UNHCO argues that there is very little information with regards to (un)safe abortions and post-abortion care, as well as legal rights on this topic. Moreover, there is limited information on family planning as a right. There are major gaps in knowledge with regard to newborn care and adolescents health. During phase I the project was guided by a well-developed results framework. This framework clearly lines out from where the project departed and what it wanted to reach. Two of the indicators identify how many people they wanted to reach either through group interventions or individual interventions. With regard to group interventions the project aim at reaching approximately 1.3 people in the next five years (from a baseline of approximately 600,000). With regard to individual encounters, the project aim to reach approximately 160,000 persons over the next five years (this is to be added on to the baseline of having reached approximately 340,000 during phase I).D","Título completo del proyecto: Fortalecimiento de la seguridad alimentaria de la población vulnerable de Juja Farm mediante el empoderamiento y la mejora de las capacidades de la mujeres de la comunidad.

The Embassy has recently prepared new support for a Maternal Health Project Phase II 2015-19. The project will be scaling up their work to include SRHR during this next project phase. RFSU through the Sida Health framework agreement, has provided previous technical and managerial assistance to the project in 2011-2014. The objective of RFSU’s TA for 2015-2016 is to continue contributing to the effective implementation of the complex MHP project which involves a large number of diverse organizations (eigh additional NGOs). Under the proposed contract 2015-16, RFSU will continue to provide both managerial and technical support to UNHCO and their implementing partners. However, as compared to the previous support period for Phase I, this contract will have more emphasis on technical support in the area of SRHR which is a new area to the MHP. RFSU is specialised on SRHR. The TA from RFSU strengthens the ability in MHP to directly contribute to fulfilment of the Embassy result strategy 2014-18 across our result areas. Weak maternal health and SRH services are both direct and underlying causes for ill-health, gender inequality and contained poverty. The TA is drawn down from the Sida Framework Agreement for Health, of which RFSU is a consortium member. Partners under Sida´s Framework Agreements are preceded by system reviews looking at areas such as budget, cost-effectiveness, relevance, effectiveness before Sida signs framework agreements. This is also the case for the Health Framework Agreement. Prior experience from same set-up with TA from RFSU to MHP shows improvement of reporting on results by the partner.The embassy assesses that the requested support to MHP, with particular attention to SRHR provides quality assurance aspects to implementing the MHP future activities.","Extension of agreement with Naguru Teenage Centre with one year see contribution 51180006","Intrenal audit for appraisal of MHP VHR","Technical support to Naguru Teenage Health and Information center to develop a new strategic plan and budget, as well as to ensure quality result reporting.","Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) are an integral and important part of Sweden’s development policy and the feminist foreign policy, and essential to achieving equitable and sustainable development.Sweden’s long tradition of support to SRHR is strongly reflected in both the Swedish Government’s Aid Policy Framework and the Results Strategy for Sweden’s international development cooperation with Uganda, 2014-2018.SRH is a prioritized area for the Government of Uganda, but the sector remains underfunded hampering progress on SRHR indicators. In addition, progress is challenged by the fact that sexual rights continue to be a controversial and sensitive topic in the country.The International HIV/AIDS Alliance (IHAA) have applied to the Embassy of Sweden in Kampala for funding of MSEK 110 to manage and implement the “Uganda Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights Umbrella” (hereafter referred to as the SRHR Umbrella) during the 5-year period 2016-2021.Sweden will sign an Agreement with the International HIV/AIDS Alliance (IHAA) who will have the overall programmatic and financial responsibility for the SRHR Umbrella. IHAA’s Linking Organization - Community Health Alliance Uganda (CHAU), will be the lead implementing partner in Uganda.The intervention aims to “contribute to improved SRHR and HIV outcomes in Uganda” through four outcomes; 1) Expanded access and increased use of quality, inclusive and integrated SRHR and HIV services among vulnerable and key populations 2) Increased adoption of safer sexual practices among vulnerable and key populations, 3) An enabling SRHR and HIV environment for vulnerable and key populations, and 4) Strengthened institutional capacity of implementing organisations to deliver quality and inclusive SRHR and HIV programmes in Uganda.The SRHR Umbrella’s goal and outcomes will be achieved by increasing access to and use of quality, inclusive and integrated SRHR and HIV services and by promoting positive healthy sexual relationships that improve SRHR indicators by reducing STI/HIV transmissions, maternal mortality and the unmet need for family planning.The umbrella will give high priority to promoting the full sexual and reproductive rights of individuals, and to addressing stigma and discrimination in all its complexity as an imperative for removing barriers to accessing health services.Sweden and IHAA have a long-standing relationship. IHAA have received global support from Sweden since 1993 and is currently also receiving regional funding. IHAA’s linking organization in Uganda, Community Health Alliance Uganda (CHAU), recently (February 2016) received full accreditation as a linking organization.The SRHR Umbrella will identify 19 implementing partners through competitive calls for proposals and through rigorous capacity assessments. CHAU will sign individual agreements with each of the implementing partners who will be responsible for implementing agreed work plans and budgets. In addition the SRHR Umbrella will support 5 NGO's with innovation grants, bringing the total number of grant recieving partners to 24.A cornerstone in the umbrella is to develop and strengthen the capacity of the implementing partners in order to increase sustainability and local ownership.The 19 implementing partners will carry out different activities, including peer led interventions, youth friendly sexuality education and service provision, behavior change communication, community sensitization and outreach, policy briefs and dialogue, and social mobilization.The SRHR Umbrella will target 14 districts, primarily covering the central and western regions of Uganda (Buyende, Hoima, Jinja, Kabarole, Kamwenge, Kyenjojo, Luwero, Mbarara, Mubende, Ntungamo, Kampala, Mukono, Iganga and Nakaseke).The districts have been selected basing on the following criteria: High HIV prevalence, high population of young people, low to medium ART/HCT coverage, high teenage","Naguru Teenage Information and Health Center (NTIHC) has applied to Sweden for funding of 38.2 MSEK to implement its 2015-2020 Strategic Plan.

NTIHC has developed into a centre of excellence, in Uganda and in the region, and has built a considerable expertise in adolescent SRHR (ASRHR). NTIHC is one of the few organisations in the country offering quality ASRHR services and it fills an important gap in the overall SRHR platform in Uganda.The Embassy of Sweden in Uganda is supporting NTIHC’s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan with a total of 38.2 M SEK (84% of the Strategic Plan budget). The Strategic Plan redirects the previous focus from mainly service delivery to a stronger emphasis on best practice and advocacy.Through the Contribution; NTIHC will receive technical support by RFSU through the framework agreement with Indevelop with the aim to 1) improve quality ASRHR service delivery, 2) strengthen advocacy capacity and 3) provide management support. The support will be provided over a period of 14 months and specific attention will be devoted to build NTIHC’s capacity to implement the new Strategic Plan and to increase NTIHC’s capacity for resource mobilization in order to reduce dependence on Swedish support. The budget for the technical support amounts to SEK 1 324 800.RFSU also provided technical support in 2014-2015.

También, se pretende el trabajo conjunto de la ONG local con el orfanato como medida de incluir estas mejora de condiciones también a los/as niños/as que por su situación viven en la calle y/ o practican la mendicidad. Este proyecto, pretende la inclusión de estos/as menores en el orfanato, por tratarse de un lugar seguro y vital para estas personas. Así, tras elaborar un estudio en el orfanato LAR BETHERL donde se evaluaban las necesidades de los menores residentes en el orfanato con sus consiguientes indicadores de satisfacción y deficiencia se concluyó que las necesidades básicas de los/as menores que muestran mayores deficiencias que necesitaban un apoyo en su gestión, en lo que se deriva más trabajo en este ámbito, y un aumento económico que podrían ser sufragadas total o parcialmente son las siguientes: Salud Educación El proyecto en si sigue con el duro trabajo diario del orfanato, trabaja en esa línea, pero reforzando en salud y educación. Los/as cuidadores/educadores y demás empleados/as del centro velan por el cuidado y desarrollo de los/as más pequeños, pero debido a la falta de recursos este trabajo como venimos mencionando es insuficiente para paliar todas las necesidades de los/as residentes en el orfanato.

La mayoría de las comidas se basa en arroz, maíz y algunos vegetales, carecen de pescado y carne suficiente para conseguir esta dieta equilibrada. En salud general, no tienen una atención sanitaria básica y la que se hace en atención temprana con los bebés es casi nula. Los recursos económicos no son suficientes para cubrir esta necesidad, la salud pública del país tampoco puede hacer frente a esta necesidad, con lo cual el centro se ve obligado a pagar por consultas médicas y medicamentos necesarios.

Identification of children with disabilities or disabling diseases is conducted by examining screened children at the eye&ear camps. Around 10 000 children will be provided with rehabilitation and/or simple treatment necessary for school attendance and prevention of additional morbidity. An estimated 75 children with severe visual or hearing disability will undergo a four month rehabilitation in the hospital run by the local partner organization (Children?s Hospital for Eye Ear and Rehabilitation Services CHEERS). To reach these goals volunteers are trained among female health workers teachers and students so they can identify children with neurosensory disabilities or at risk of disability whom will be sent to eye&ear camps for medical evaluation. This contributes to reducing the prevalence of disabling neurosensory conditions which is also achieved by raising awareness of health related to sight and hearing among locals as well as decisionmakers. The project envisages all four aspects of health care delivery: preventive promotive curative and rehabilitative services. The project is to be realized as a three-year pilot in two districts in the Terai region of Nepal. The project is to be realized as a collaboration between a Nepalese NGO called B.P. Eye Foundation which has developed the project idea and PSR Finland which has been contacted by B.P. Eye foundation to act as a project partner. Based on the previous work of B.P.Eye Foundation this collaborative project also aims to change the Nepalese view on the rights of the disabled remove barriers and stigmas associated with disabilities and enable children with disabilities to become productive citizens. For sustainability of the activities the government of Nepal has made a preliminary commitment of implementing these protocols in other districts and eventually the whole of Nepal once the results of the pilot project turn out to be encouraging. B.P. Eye Foundation holds monthly meetings with the government and representatives from Early Childhood Development Center. The project is planned to start in 2015 with project duration of three years.","La intervención contempla la dotación de: 1 - mobiliario administrativo (mesas, sillas, armarios) 2- equipamiento sanitario (camillas, sillas ginecológicas, camas articuladas, sillas de ruedas, etc.) y 3- equipamiento médico básico (material de laboratorio, aparatos médicos, etc.)., del Centro de Salud de Villa, en Haití, que fue destruido por el terremoto de 2010. Esta microacción de dotación de mobiliario y equipamiento complementa la actuación que está siendo llevada a cabo por Cruz Roja Española, junto a Cruz Roja Haitiana, para mejorar la situación de vulnerabilidad física de las infraestructuras sanitarias destruidas por el terremoto del 2010 en Haití, a través de: 1 - Reconstrucción de dicho centro de salud: Dotado de 3 salas de consultas, 2 salas de urgencias, 1 sala de observación, 2 salas materno-infantiles, farmacia, laboratorio, sala de colección de muestras, 1 sala de espera, recepción, despacho de administración, almacén, sala de personal, aseos personal y baños publicos, cocina, 1 residencia para médicos residentes con 2 apartamentos. 2- Actividades de Formación en Salud Comunitaria y Promoción de la Higiene al centro escolar (profesores y alumnos) de la misma sección comunal. El centro de salud Foi et Vie de Villa es un centro comunitario gestionado y financiado por la Saint Boniface Haiti Foundation (FSB), fundación sin ánimo de lucro que presta servicios sanitarios en Haití con la acreditación del Ministerio de Salud. La reconstrucción y equipamiento del Centro de Salud de Villa, forma parte de la actuación integral de recuperación de las condiciones de vida de la población haitiana de los Departamentos más afectados por el terremoto del 2010, (Oeste y Sudeste) (Operación terremoto 2010-2015 de Cruz Roja Española y Cruz Roja Haitiana).

Antes del terremoto llevaba un año funcionando y daba una amplia cobertura socio-sanitaria a la comuna de Côtes de Fer, de unas 40.000 personas. Servía también de filtro de primera atención para la derivación de casos (triade) para no saturar al propio Hospital de Saint Boniface. En el año 2009 atendió 6.032 pacientes. En el centro de salud, se daban los servicios de consulta médica general, consulta de pediatría, consulta de ginecología y prenatal, urgencias, programa de vacunaciones, consulta de nutrición, educación para la salud, radiología básica y consulta e información VIH/SIDA. Se disponía también de un servicio de ambulancia para el traslado de los casos que requerían un tratamiento o manejo hospitalario. A día de hoy las actividades que se llevaban a cabo en dicha estructura se han visto mermadas y desplazadas al terreno aledaño de la edificación dañada, utilizando tiendas de campaña y pequeñas construcciones de madera.

However in order to increase effectiveness totally new strategies will be applied.TB continues to be an essential health problem in Somalia. The disease hasn't been beaten yet but rather new problems emerge such as multi-drug resistant forms of TB resulting in much more complex treatment regimens and bigger danger to the population.LSV will continue to diagnose and treat TB patients in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. As a new strategy the private sector health care providers (clinics and pharmacies) and local communities will be engaged in the effort in a systematic way in order to strengthen a holistic public-private-people partnership approach to tackling the disease. In addition collaboration with the local maternity and child health facility network will be strengthened. The overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of TB burden and suffering in Somalia. The immediate objectives of the project include 1) To increase TB awareness and participation of communities in TB control. 2) To increase TB awareness and participation of private practitioners and pharmacists in TB control in. 3) To diagnose and treat patients at two TB centers according to WHO's DOTS protocol. 4) To provide TB culture services and drug susceptibility tests (DST) for suspected MDR cases.Regarding the cross-cutting themes the project will empower women and facilitate their access to TB services. In addition the project will reduce inequality by providing an access to TB services for internally displaced persons (IDPs). When it comes to climate proofing there are no negative impacts on environment. For example thanks to community DOTS there will be less daily traveling to TB Centers.The main project partners include NGO called PSR and National TB Programs (NTPs). LSV will strengthen their capacity in all the fields described above.The main beneficiaries include local people of Hargeisa Mogadishu and nomads living in nearby areas who have TB or belong to risk groups. The project will help the poorest of the poor.

Though the expected lifetime has become longer in Nepal the amount of women who get uterine prolapse has not decreased. It has doubled from the year 2008. The problem is in the Nepalese culture. It does not protect the the women after they given a birth to a child. Many of the women are expected to work hard soon after the delivery.The aim of this project is to secure a better health for all in Nepal and to prevent Uterine prolapse- by supporting them to appreciate the motherhood and to protect the mothers after the delivery - by counselling in breast-feeding and in child care- by teaching right ways to lift and to work - by guiding to healthy living habits and versatile diet- by encouraging to smoke free lifestyle with no intoxicating agents or fear of AIDSIt is planned that the project will reach all the 75 districts in Nepal in three years. Partners in the districts will be the health and education departments of the districts and also the voluntary women workers groups which already exist in the districts. According to the plan in each district a three day seminar will be arranged in which all the health teachers from the schools health assistants midwives and the voluntary women workers in the district will be invited. Each year about 2500 health workers can take part in the seminar (100 in each district). All these will get the health education teaching material used during the seminar so that they can use it also in their own work.

Finland's contribution to the programme has been 12.5 million euros. The main objective of the programme is to improve the health and nutrition status of the Somali population. As a result of this maternal and infant mortality has reduced significantly. The programme also supports the institutional development of the Somali health care system. The primary beneficiaries of the programme are women girls and children whose access to health services is relatively the weakest. The programme is managed by UNICEF. Other UN partners include WHO and UNFPA. The programme has achieved most of the planned results. It is supposed to be ending by the end of 2016 and replaced by new programmes and projects. The planned budget has however not realized and the programme is severely under-resourced. At the same time the planning of the new programmes and initiatives that are supposed to replace JHNP in 2017 has delayed. The Somali authorities and the UN have therefore requested the donors to continue their support to the core elements of the programme including the Essential Package of Health Services (health clinics) and the ongoing training of midwifes and to extend the duration of the programme until April-2017.The Department for Africa and the Middle East proposes to increase Finland's funding to the programme by 3M?.","Contribuir a mejorar las condiciones de vida de la población refugiada víctima de la crisis siria mediante la mejora de su acceso a los servicios de atención primaria de salud en el distrito de Saida y Beirut (Líbano).","El proyecto tiene como objetivo proporcionar asistencia obstétrica y ginecológica a mujeres sirias, palestinas y libanesas en los 5 hospitales gestionados por la Media Luna Roja de Palestina en el Líbano.","El equipo médico ha asistido a 4803 personas tanto en el Hospital ROLE 1, a quienes han solicitado asistencia de urgencia, como en sus propias poblaciones, con visitas periódicas.Asimismo se han adquirido medicinas, botiquines y kits de primeros auxilios para su entrega en las localidades.","PEGASE is the EU?s main mechanism to support Palestinian state building and the implementation of the Palestine National Development Plan. Pegase mechanism is a program of direct financial support combined with technical support interventions of the Commission. Through Pegase the European Commission and other donors (incl. Finland) generate Direct Financial Support towards the Palestinian Administration?s (PA) recurrent costs. Due to the political situation the PA suffers from chronic funding shortage and is dependent on external aid. A new window was opened to Pegase in 2013 with the aim of supporting the East Jerusalem hospitals. The East Jerusalem hospitals are suffering from financial crisis which threatens their very existence. Their collapse would have severe consequences for the medical care of Palestinians. Supporting development in East Jerusalem is also a policy goal of both the PA and the EU. In 2014 Finland?s support amounting to 25 million euros was directed to the East Jerusalem Hospitals component. The aid directed via the PA made the continuation of the operations of East Jerusalem hospital network possible and hence the continuation of medical services to the Palestinian population. The relationship between the PA and the East Jerusalem hospitals continued. The hospitals play a key role in connecting the East Jerusalem to the rest of Palestinian territories. The program also enabled the hospitals to further develop their medical services. In the years 2015-2016 Finland's support of 4 million euros will be anew directed to East Jerusalem hospitals. The aim of Finland?s support will be to guarantee equal access to health care for all Palestinians.

The people of the area are poor and the families cannot afford educating their children without monetary help. The poor infrastructure of education (school premises) makes it difficult to deliver education - the state should take care of maintaining school buildings but this has not been possible. Healthcare is also underdeveloped in the area and AIDS and malaria complicate the life of the community.

The aim is to help the community so that children and especially girls can go to school without financial limitation. The NGO also supports young people in their further education and thus securing better future for themselves. The school heath care work started by the NGO is specific in the area and there is good progress in preventing diseases (see attachment report by the school nurse Edita Tesha).The main beneficiaries of the project are school children. The main activities for the funding period are maintenance and development of the health care system in the primary and secondary school of Kilingi by supplementing the equipment and increasing health education development of school education and the learning environment as well as improving sanitation by building new toilets to the school. The health education is beneficial also for the families of the pupils.Of the cross-cutting objectives of the Finnish development cooperation policy the actions of this project implement especially these two: promoting gender equality and reducing of inequality of all kind.

Esta circunstancia tiene varias causas, siendo una de las más importantes que los recursos sanitarios son escasos y ello se debe en parte a la insuficiencia de personal cualificado: Las enfermeras de primer ciclo no cubren las exigencias sanitarias actuales del país, y faltan agentes sanitarios de calidad. Desde el año 1997, las Religiosas de María Inmaculada gestionan la escuela de enfermeras ?Vicenta María de Segou, la cual está aprobada oficialmente por el estado. El centro forma enfermeras de primer ciclo y goza de una gran reputación a nivel nacional dado sus buenos resultados en los exámenes nacionales. La evolución de la sociedad y la necesidad de una mayor cobertura sanitaria han hecho insuficiente la formación del primer ciclo, por lo que tanto alumnas como la población en general y las autoridades sanitarias y políticas han solicitado a las Religiosas de María Inmaculada la posibilidad de completar la formación del primer ciclo con este ciclo superior para formas agentes sanitarios de calidad y especializados en salud pública y atención materno infantil. El objetivo es formar a 240 enfermeras de ciclo superior en la rama de salud pública y atención materno infantil, mediante la construcción y equipamiento de un centro de formación y proporcionar las condiciones de salubridad necesarias con la construcción de dos bloques de 3 letrinas en Segou.

La baja pluviometria, la deficiencia de las cosechas, los múltiples embarazos, la ignorancia de los padres, las malas prácticas alimentarías, el destete precoz de los niños/as, las enfermedades no curadas, la pobreza, son las causas de la desnutrición. La pequeña estación de lluvia ha llegado con seís semanas de retraso y tres veces menos abundante de lo habitual, por lo que los precios de los alimentos aumentaron un 18%. La mayoría no tiene los medios para asumir este aumento de precios. La principal preocupación son las mujeres, los niños y los huérfanos, se ven niños tan débiles, desnutridos avanzados, que tienen muy pocas posibilidades ( menos del 40% ) de sobrevivir. El objeto de la intervención es salvar vidas y reducir la vulnerabilidad de la comunidad.

","The rising global burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is being borne primarily by low- and middle-income countries, with populations of African-origin being at greater risk than white populations. Notably, there is a profound increase in prevalence of T2D amongst urban black South Africans (SA), particularly women. We hypothesize that lifestyle factors influence metabolic pathways, thereby increasing the risk for T2D. In the caregivers of the Birth to Twenty (Bt20) cohort women (n=1,251), from the urban township of Soweto in Johannesburg, SA, underwent extensive testing (body composition, socioeconomic status, fasting blood samples) in 2003 and 2013/4. Based on analyses of fasting glucose collected in 2013/4, we will classify women as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or T2D. Eighty women per group (n=240) will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to confirm their diabetic status. Longitudinal metabolomics analyses will be performed on fasting plasma samples from 2003 and 2015, and their 30 and 120 min OGTT blood samples from 2015. We aim to i) identify metabolites and metabolic pathways that predict progression from NGT to IGT and T2D, ii) identify metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with insulin sensitivity and secretion in black SA women and iii) determine whether lifestyle factors can modify these findings.","14-PR1-2867/MEDICOS DEL MUNDO/Mauritania/635.291 ?/Refuerzo de la equidad y la cobertura universal del sistema de salud de la Willay","Por la importancia de sus prestaciones para la población, el Centro de Salud de El Bayad, constituye una pieza fundamental del servicio de salud de la Región del Adrar para reducir directamente, la morbimortalidad de la población que puede estimarse en 11.000 hab.

Se estima que la mortalidad materna se sitúa en torno a 686 de cada 100 mil nacimientos. Esta inquietante tasa se debe esencialmente a la elevada proporción de embarazos de riesgo (embarazos precoces), y a un retraso en la detección precoz a nivel comunitario y a su seguimiento prenatal, unido a una escasa accesibilidad a cuidados de obstetricia urgentes y de calidad. El 56% de la población juvenil mauritana mantiene relaciones sexuales no protegidas a la edad de 16 años, exponiéndose a graves riesgos de contagio de enfermedades de transmisión sexual (VIH/SIDA) o a embarazos no deseados o abortos clandestinos sin seguimiento médico. En lo que se refiere a la mortalidad infanto-juvenil, este indicador sigue siendo muy elevado, situándose en torno a 123¿ niños menores de 5 años, 70 de los cuales durante el primer año y 53 durante el primer mes de vida. Sus principales causas son las Infecciones Respiratorias Agudas (IRA), el paludismo, la malnutrición o las epidemias de sarampión. Por otro lado, el 80% de los centros de salud tienen un déficit cuantitativo de suministro de agua, así como unas condiciones sanitarias inadecuadas, careciendo de un sistema de gestión de residuos biomédicos, lo que conlleva un alto riesgo para la población y para el medio ambiente de su entorno. Por todo ello, el presente proyecto consolida sus actuaciones en las comunas de Riadh y El Mina las cuales, a pesar de las mejoras obtenidas gracias a intervenciones previas de TDH, se sitúan aun entre las comunas más vulnerables en materia de salud de la provincia de Nuakchot. Además, la continua llegada de poblaciones de zonas rurales influye negativamente en la vulnerabilidad sanitaria de esas comunas, aumentando la precariedad respecto a su acceso a servicios básicos.

Its activities, including current projects funded by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and by the European Union, are implemented with an integrated approach with the aim to improve Maternal and Child Health in the three states. The IDC’s voluntary contributions channeled in the region through selected UN agencies also contribute to achieve Italy’s overall country strategy for Sudan.Given the positive results achieved by the IDC over time in North-Eastern Sudan, this proposal aims to contribute to achieve and improve the expected outcomes of existing Italian activities. These must be aligned to the basic principles of the IDC, already applied and visible in all activities currently implemented in Sudan. These key principles are those of “sector and geographic concentration”, whereby a focus on specific sectors and areas of a given country is encouraged to foster efficacy and efficiency; and “to guarantee the continuation with past and ongoing activities that have achieved positive results, aiming to complete what’s still necessary and ensure their functioning and quality”.The proposed initiative is part of such framework and aims to ensure the continuity and complementarity of the initiative AID 10004 “Strengthening Primary Health Care in the States of Red Sea and Kassala – Sudan” and the Delegated Action initiative funded by the EU “Promoting Qualitative Health Services in Eastern Sudan” (PQHS)”. The proposed initiative is coherent and complementary with EU policies and focuses on two sectors – health and education –included as priority sectors in the second pillar of the “European Consensus on Development” approved in 2005.The initiative will contribute to improving Primary Health Care and particularly maternal and child health, and stems from the requests of local authorities. Moreover, it is aligned to Federal priorities in the health sector, “to reduce maternal and child mortality and support development of human resources in health”.Within this framework, the IDC has requested UNOPS’ assistance to facilitate additional activities in support of the infrastructural component and improvement of the health sector and has sought the agency’s support through a preliminary technical assessment mission to evaluate the needs and the costs to perform some civil works in three selected facilities.General Objective: to contribute to improving the living conditions of populations in North-Eastern Sudan, through Italian funds channeled to Sudan and in addition to and integration with initiatives funded by international donors.Specific Objective: to contribute to achieve the expected outcomes of initiatives funded in the health sector by Italian funds and EU funds implemented by Italy in North Eastern Sudan, particularly with regards to the improvement of health infrastructure.The objective of the IDC’s contribution is to utilize UNOPS’ project management and procurement experience, its efficient financial regulations and proven accountability, to source established companies or Sudan-based NGOs to implement the activities of rehabilitation of the buildings for 3 selected facilities.","The overall goal of Global Fund Sierra Leone is to develop and scale up a comprehensive National Response to HIV/AIDS that includes adequate Prevention, Treatment, Care and Support for those affected.

Specifically this project is to assist the Government of Sierra Leone in adequate staffing of Foreign Medical Teams (FMT) to Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) and/or assigned health facilities in the country. The project is funded by the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's (WB) Fund for the Poorest.The 2014 Ebola (EVD) outbreak is the largest Ebola outbreak in history and the first in West Africa. The spread of EVD has been accelerated by limited health infrastructure, poor hygiene practices, and many other factors. The EVD has further impeded already limited access to basic health care facilities in both urban and rural areas resulting in reduction of basic health care. Lack of human resources has been identified by the governments of three affected countries (Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia) as well as the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a critical factor impeding the delivery of Ebola care. The project is part of a wider regional project providing Ebola Emergency Repsonse to all three affected countries. Deliverables of the project are to establish an operational platform capable of facilitating the deployment of International Responders (IRs) in effective coordinated support of the national Ebola response efforts. UNOPS will create a Coordination Office and set up an operational platform that will cover Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea based in Accra in close coordination with the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).

The previous PRRO featured capacity augmentation and policy development components to optimise the disaster response structures and policy frameworks of the Government of the Philippines in support of the Philippine Development Plan (2011-2016). As the Philippines consistently ranks high among the most disaster-prone countries in the world,a strategic and proactive approach to building resilience is crucial to mitigate the negative impacts of hazards and enable the swift return to socio-economic vitality following disasters.The main goals of the operation were to:- meet the food security and nutrition needs of women,men,girls,and boys affected by conflict and natural disasters in Mindanao;- enhance government and community disaster preparedness,and response systems at the national and some sub-national levels to ensure timely responses to natural disasters;- advise government departments on the development of gender-responsive food security and nutrition policies; and- provide life-saving food assistance in response to disasters.This PRRO complemented the Special Operation 200706,which aimed to enhance the disaster preparedness and response capabilities of the government. It also supported the ongoing programme of the Government in Central Mindanao to promote peacebuilding,reconstruction,and development in conflict-affected areas. This operation contributed to WFP Strategic Objectives 1,2 and 3,to Millennium Development Goals 1,2,3 and 4,and to the Zero Hunger Challenge.","Capacity Development for Health and Nutrition","Transition: Towards Resilience and Zero Hunger in Pakistan","Restoring Food&Nutrition Security and Building Resilient Livelihoods in Earthquake Affected Areas","Nutrition Support for Children and Women and Strengthening Community Capacity to Reduce Disaster Risks","Assistance to Refugees and Vulnerable Food-Insecure Populations","Food Assistance to Refugees","Food and Safety Net Assistance to Refugee Camp Residents and  Returning Rwandan Refugees.","Food Assistance For Vulnerable Groups and Refugees","Reducing Malnutrition and Strengthening Resilience to Shocks  for a Food Secure Somalia","Uganda PRRO - Food assistance to vulnerable households in Uganda","CP-UGCO-(2016-2020)","The PRRO is aligned to the 2015-2030 National Strategic Programme for Development and,in particular,to the key areas of the government's food security and nutrition strategy: food and social safety net interventions,investment in agriculture,and improved basic social services and nutrition. The PRRO is also in line with the 2013-2016 United Nations Integrated Strategic Framework.The PRRO supported the Government in saving lives,rebuilding livelihoods and resilience,while concentrating its activities in the most food insecure and disaster-prone areas. WFP support focused both on responding to nutritional deficiencies within targeted communities and on helping reinforce government capacity both at central and local levels,in line with the government plan to decentralize its capacities by 2030.By enhancing its preparedness and by delivering assistance via general food distributions to drought affected populations,WFP response contributed to WFP's strategic objective 1 (Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies) and supported the government to confront the multiple disasters that affect the country.WFP's cooperation with the government also extended to activities contributing to the achievement of WFP's strategic objective 2 (Support or restore food security and nutrition and establish or rebuild livelihoods in fragile settings and following emergencies) by assisting the population in recovering from shocks by initiating cash for assets activities. WFP also aligned its work with the government priority to fight acute and chronic malnutrition (WFP's strategic objective 4: Reduce undernutrition and break the intergenerational cycle of hunger). WFP's activities included the treatment of acute malnutrition in children 6-59 months old and the prevention of chronic malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in infants by focusing on the first 1,000 days. WFP also supported the government in setting up the institutionalization of an enhanced social protection programme in the country.No resilience activities in support of strategic objective 3 (Reduce risk and enable people,communities and countries to meet their own food and nutrition needs) were carried out in 2015. The general socio-economic environment in the country was not favorable to such an approach. The drought has had a lasting impact on livelihoods and the ability to cope with external shocks. WFP consequently prioritized SO2 activities.PRRO nutrition activities contributed to the Kore Lavi (Creole for 'Supporting Life') consortium project which aimed to reduce food insecurity and vulnerability by supporting the Government of Haiti in establishing a replicable safety net system and preventing child undernutrition,using the ' 1000 Days' approach.","The country programme (CP) 200641 was designed to respond to national priorities identified in coordination with the Government of Guatemala. The CP is aligned firstly with the Zero Hunger Pact (2012-2016),to reduce the prevalence of chronic malnutrition,prevent and reduce infant mortality related to acute malnutrition. Secondly,it is aligned with the Ministry of Agriculture's Family Agriculture Programme to Strengthen Peasants' Economy (2013-2016) and the National Policy for Integral Rural Development (2009) and,finally,with the National Policy on the Promotion and Integrated Development of Guatemalan Women and its Implementation Plan (2008-2023). The programme is also aligned with the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (2015-2019)In line with WFP Strategic Objectives 3 and 4,the CP aimed to achieve the following objectives:Component 1 (Nutrition): Prevent stunting,reduce micronutrient deficiencies  among children aged 6-23 months and among pregnant and lactating women (PLW),and improve household nutrition practices by creating a mother-to-mother network (SO 4: Reduce undernutrition and break the intergenerational cycle of hunger);Component 2 (Resilience): Build resilience and reduce vulnerability to shocks among subsistence farmers through food assistance-for-assets (FFA) activities,enhance government capacity to mitigate disaster impacts (SO 3: Reduce risk and enable people,communities,and countries to meet their own food and nutrition needs);Component 3 (Purchase for Progress - P4P): Connect smallholder farmers' organizations (FOs) to markets by using WFP's purchasing power as a leverage to develop farmers' capacity to respond to market demand and promote local procurement as a government policy. (SO 3: Reduce risk and enable people,communities and countries to meet their own food and nutrition needs).Nutrition education,gender equality and the strengthening of institutional capacity were integrated into all components. Although the country programme had not foreseen school feeding activities,the government requested WFP to provide technical assistance in improving the quality of the national school feeding programme. WFP also supported the mainstreaming of nutrition in the national AIDS programme by introducing nutrition-sensitive activities for people infected with HIV. WFP contributed to revising protocols and contingency plans for emergency preparedness and response to severe shocks,disasters and food insecurity at municipal and community levels.","The Cuba country programme (CP) was designed to support the Government of Cuba's efforts to improve efficiency and enhance the sustainability and targeting of social protection programmes. The country programme is aligned with WFP's Strategic Result Framework and specifically supports: Strategic Objective 1 to save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies; Strategic Objective 3 to reduce risk and enable people,communities and countries to meet their own food and nutrition needs; and Strategic Objective 4 to reduce undernutrition and break the intergenerational cycle of hunger.Through the country programme,WFP is supporting national institutions to: i) reduce micronutrient deficiencies among children under 2 and pregnant and lactating women by providing direct food assistance and capacity building activities; ii) create marketing opportunities for producers and traders of agricultural products; iii) promote innovation and develop good practices for linking local procurement to social protection programmes for scaling up to the national level; iv) assess,prepare and,if needed,respond to emergencies; and v) improve the capacities of communities to manage climatic shocks and risks.WFP activities are in line with government priorities established for updating the economic model as outlined in the Socio-Economic Policy Guidelines,with particular focus on the enhancement of social safety net programmes; increased agricultural production and efficiency; import substitution of beans; and strengthening of value chains and decentralized decision making. WFP continued supporting the National Plan for the Prevention and Control of Anemia (NPPCA),focusing on iron supplementation,food fortification,food diversification and nutrition education. WFP collaborated with the government in developing a new management model and innovative approaches for strengthening social protection.

The successive shocks of prolonged drought and flooding that have hit Mauritania in recent years have critically undermined the resilience of the most vulnerable populations who rely on traditional rain fed agriculture and extensive breeding activities for their livelihoods. Results from the Food Security Monitoring Survey and Integrated Food Security Phase Classification,conducted respectively in June and November 2014,have highlighted a deterioration in the national food security situation since June 2013.This Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation (PRRO),launched in June 2014,is the continuity of a three-year cycle that started in the aftermath of the 2012 food crisis. Building on lessons learned from previous operations,this PRRO aimed to protect livelihoods and reduce acute malnutrition,while tackling underlying causes of food insecurity and malnutrition to reduce the impact of seasonal stress and shocks. WFP provided food and nutrition assistance to cover immediate needs of vulnerable households through targeted and flexible food and nutrition safety nets while enhancing assets and skills to contribute in building long-term capacity to mitigate shocks.WFP's intervention focused on (i) supporting beneficiaries in emergency contexts through general food distribution (GFD) and unconditional cash transfer; (ii) enhancing assets and skills of beneficiaries through Food assistance for Assets (FFA) activities; and (iii) treating and preventing acute malnutrition through targeted and blanket supplementary feeding.This operation was aligned to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (2012-2015),the Inter-sectorial Nutrition Action Plan (2011-2015),and the National Protocol for Management of Acute Malnutrition (December 2011). The project supported the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and 2014 Humanitarian Strategic Resource Plan and contributed to WFP' Strategic Objectives 1,3 and 4.The operation was developed through a thorough consultative process,involving national authorities including the steering committee of the National Social Protection Strategy,the United Nations agencies,partner NGOs and donors.","Since the response to the 2012 food crisis in Senegal,WFP has scaled up its food assistance in the country,expandingPRRO operations from areas affected by the Casamance conflict to all regions of Senegal. The new transitional PRRO 200681 for the period of 2015-2016 was approved by the Executive Board in November 2014. It succeeds PRRO 200138 which ended in December 2014,and concentrates on localized relief,recovery and resilience support,paving the way to a longer term programme to follow. The PRRO 200681 is aligned with the Plan Senegal Emergent,and contributes to the Sahel 2014-2016 Strategic Response Plan,the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and WFP's Regional Resilience Roadmap for West Africa. It supports Strategic Objectives 2 (Support food security and nutrition and (re)build livelihoods in fragile settings and following emergencies); 3 (Reduce risk and enable people,communities and countries to meet their own food and nutrition needs); and 4 (Reduce undernutrition and break the intergenerational cycle of hunger). It further contributes towards Millennium Development Goals 1-5 and 7 and feeds into the Plan Senegal Emergent.The PRRO assists the country by adopting a twin track approach to address food insecurity in communities affected by shock combined with recovery and resilience support,and treating Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) where prevalence exceeds 10 percent,as well as preventing it where it exceeds 15 percent. It also strengthens national preparedness and response capacities with integrated early warning systems and response tools.The operation seeks to facilitate stronger linkages between WFP's investments in relief,recovery and resilience-building initiatives to help the most vulnerable break out of the cycle of hunger.In Casamance,where the household economy approach analysis confirmed the importance of school meals as a safety net for poor households,the PRRO supports school meals activities in preschools and primary schools to reduce dropouts. It also aims to facilitate the return of displaced people,providing resettlement packages.In 2015 relief activities included targeted food and voucher distributions (Targeted Food Assistance- TFA) during the lean season,and Targeted Supplementary Feeding (TSF) for children under five and Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) as a treatment to Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM),and in response to the 2015 Strategic Response Plan and the government's appeal for urgent assistance.Recovery activities comprised: school meals,Blanket Supplementary Feeding for children under two and PNW as a prevention of acute malnutrition,the creation of Village food Security Stocks (VSS),building of assets under the Food Assistance for Assets programme and the Rural Resilience Initiative.The creation of VSS aims to facilitate access to cereals by communities during the lean season and contain price speculation. It also encourages communities to manage future cereal harvests and stocks more effectively. Stocks are allocated to vulnerable communities with the condition that they will aim at replenishing them with a reasonable percentage agreed by the community members themselves.Under FFA insecure communities receive food,cash or vouchers to cope with the hunger season,depending on seasonal activities. At the same time,by participating in assets building activities they benefit from long lasting improvements in their food security and livelihoods. FFA is implemented either as standalone activity or as part of the Rural Resilience Initiative (R4),which combines food and cash assistance with asset creation,insurance,credit and savings schemes. The R4 jointly implemented by WFP and OXFAM America aims at improving food security and making farmers thrive. WFP has moved progressively from in-kind delivery to cash-based transfers which support all interventions at the exception of nutrition and VSS exclusively supported through food.","This PRRO seeks to build the resilience,protect the livelihoods and reduce malnutrition of refugees,returnees and other vulnerable people in Chad. It is aligned with Strategic Objectives 1,2 and 3,and contributes to Millennium Development Goals 1,4 and 5. The main expected outcomes of the project are as follows:i. Ensure adequate food consumption for targeted Sudanese and Central African refugees and returnees as well as food-insecure Chadian households;ii. Support the livelihoods of targeted food-insecure communities and households;iii.             Carry out FFA activities concentrated in the post-harvest period to minimize overlap with agricultural activities and migration patterns.iv.             Gradual introduction of vouchers allowing WFP to monitor market reaction and any other disruptions that may arise.Under this PRRO,WFP aimed to facilitate the shift from relief to enhancing resilience by strengthening the capacities of vulnerable populations to respond to shocks by implementing a community-based approach to nutrition interventions,Community-based Participatory Planning for community and households assets creation and through the increased use of market-based mechanisms such as local purchases. It also supported efforts to strengthen the government's capacity in areas such as food security analysis,early warning and policy/ programme development with an aim to end child undernutrition.","This protracted relief and recovery operation (PRRO 200719) aims to save lives,promote stability and contribute to achieving Zero Hunger. It is a transition project from the Emergency Operation (EMOP) implemented between 2013-2014 that supports the governments' Cadre Strategique pour la Croissance et la Reduction de la Pauverte,Strategie Nationale de Securite Alimentaire and Plan d'Action Multisectorial de Politique Nationale de Nutrition (2013-2021).The PRRO contributes to WFP's Strategic Plan (2014-2017) by:- Responding to immediate food and security and nutrition needs of IDPs and returnees and protecting people affected by disasters and seasonal stress (Strategic Objective 1);- Supporting the recovery and stability of communities affected by shocks (Strategic Objective 2);- Treating moderately malnourished children under 5 and pregnant and lactating women (Strategic Objective 4); and- Providing a safety net for vulnerable primary schoolchildren (Strategic Objective 4).Activities for this project are in line with the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (2015-2019) and Millennium Development Goals 1 and 4.

It supports the West Africa Regional Disease Surveillance Capacity Strengthening Project managed by the World Bank, and coordinated and implemented by the West Africa Health Organization (WAHO). Disease outbreaks within the West African region are frequent and can have a particularly heavy impact on the countries’ economies and human development. As epidemics do not respect national boundaries, a high level of inter-country regional collaboration and information sharing is required to be effectively prepared for potential epidemics, such as Ebola, or to be able to prevent them from reoccurring.  Project activities include: (1) establishing centres of disease surveillance at the local level that are able to detect and report on diseases; (2) undertaking regional simulation exercises for outbreak responses and (3) training women and men in epidemiological surveillance and control.","El proyecto pretende ser una contribución al desarrollo económico rural haciendo énfasis en el apoyo a las mujeres jovenas mediante el aumento de la diversificación productiva, el acceso a tierra, el inicio de su patrimonio y la implementación de micro negocios rurales en la búsqueda de mejorar su autonomía económica.

Activities include: (1) providing training on infant and young children’s feeding practices, distributing material on proper nutrition as well as good water and sanitation practices; (2) supporting the development of school and household fruit and vegetable gardens; (3) increasing access to water through the mapping of existing water points and support for repair and maintenance; and (4) training on the importance of gender equality in order to achieve nutrition improvements.","The initiative aims to address several development needs and challenges all linked to underlying poverty and lack of basic services in the remote rural areas in the Ramechap district in Nepal, in the Azabache and Nacaome areas in Honduras and in the Gourma province in Burkina Faso. The overall objective of the initiative is to improve the health of mothers and young children, and thus contribute to reducing maternal and child mortality, through assistance with village and household-scale infrastructure, parent health education and enhanced nutrition and food security. World Neighbours Canada aims to develop and implement training programs for women and men to learn about family planning options, to increase food crop production using sustainable and ecologically sound practices, to promote proper nutrition in infants and young children under two years of age that includes breast feeding promotion, developing and implementing water system plans with participation of users etc. The project proposes to benefit more than 50,000 women, men, girls and boys.  World Neigbours Canada is working with Tamakoshi Sewa Samiti (TSS) in Nepal, L’Association d’Appui à la Promotion du Développement Durable des Communautés (APDC) in Burkina Faso, and Vecinos Honduras, in Honduras to implement this project.  This project is part of Canada’s commitment to maternal, newborn and child health programming.","This project aims to serve children less than five years of age with vitamin A supplementation and de-worming programs in Côte d’Ivoire and Kenya. The mortality rate for children less than five years of age is 73/1000 live births in Kenya and 108/1000, in Côte d’Ivoire, in 2015. Vitamin A deficiency and worm infection causes and worsens malnutrition, anemia and diseases, particularly diarrheal diseases, which are a leading cause of death for children less than five years of age in these countries. Currently, these services are provided in both countries through schools, leaving children younger than five years unreached; a gap which this project is addressing. This project is providing improved delivery of these essential health services in communities where the actual coverage for children under five years of age is low.  Project activities include: (1) increasing access to vitamin A and preventative de-worming treatments using existing community-based delivery systems; (2) strengthening the local health care system by training local health workers and community health volunteers in vitamin A supplementation and de-worming; (3) creating and utilizing a standardized toolkit for training on the implementation of responsive combined deworming and Vitamin A supplementation program targeting pre-school aged children; and (4) improving community engagement around vitamin A deficiency and de-worming in young children through responsive communication and engagement plans implementation as well as participatory activities with communities members, community leaderships and health structures and other gender equality and women’s groups.  The local partners are the Medical Assistance Programs in Kenya and Cote d'Ivoire which implement this project in 5 regions of Côte d'Ivoire (Gneby-Tiassa-Me, Bélier, Bounkani-Gontougo, Gbeke, Gôh and Indenie Duablin) and in three counties of Kenya (Siaya, Kwale and Kilifi). Vitamin Angels, a US-based NGO, is also a partner and provides in-kind contributions of albendazole (de-worming treatments) and vitamin A supplements for the duration of the project.  This project directly impacts 1.4 million children and 16,600 adults working as community health workers or volunteers. It will also indirectly impact more than 5 million people who will benefit from positive outcomes on health in the community.","This project aims to work, over a four year period, in collaboration with local governments in Nepal and Vietnam to make necessary health services and interventions accessible to children less than two years of age and to their mothers. Research has identified that the first 1,000 days of a child’s life are critical for intellectual and physical development and lifelong health. Nepal and Vietnam have both made significant strides in reducing infant and maternal mortality and improving access to essential health care. However, inequality in terms of mortality and access to services between different regions and ethnic groups remains a challenge in both of these countries. This project will address this inequality by improving the health care systems of remote regions (Banke district in Nepal) and ethnic minorities in the two countries (the Thai, H’Mong, Xinh Mun, Kho Mu and Khang of Vietnam).  Project activities include: (1) improving health management capacity; (2) improving delivery of and access to quality health care and nutrition services; (3) promoting care-seeking; (4) improving nutrition; (5) engaging men and family members to reduce gender-related barriers; (6) providing capacity building to health management teams and health workers directly; (7) engaging and offering education to men and key family members on the importance of maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) and how they can support the health of women and children; and (8) increasing the awareness of Canadians in MNCH issues through public engagement initiatives.  The project reach is a total of 38,418 direct beneficiaries in Nepal (18,056 women, 16,671 men and 3,691 women) and 20,611 in Vietnam (10,001 women, 9,172 men and 1,438 children).

The Centres of Excellence are expected to provide health services, teaching and training in three locations in Mozambique. The project is implemented in three hospitals, which serve a substantial proportion of the population in their respective areas. The three high-use hospitals, currently designated as a “Model Maternity” by the Ministry of Health, are already providing pre-service training for health workers. The project aims to improve infrastructure, improve the quality of training provided, provide supervision support and enhance referral and community linkages, in order to transform these three hospitals into “Centres of Excellence”.   Project activities include: (i) supporting communities and facilities to provide emergency transport to transfer women to facilities, including by distributing bicycle ambulances, and by providing small grants to strengthen local transport systems; (ii) establishing mobile phone networks so that smaller, peripheral health facilities can communicate easily with each Centre of Excellence; and (iii) improving the skills of at least 150 health workers using a model of competency-based training which focuses on learning-by-doing.","This project aims to reduce the mortality and morbidity rate among children under five by improving access to vaccines in Francophone countries of the Central and West Africa region, where immunization coverage is disproportionate to the affected population. Pneumonia and diarrhea are the main causes of morbidity and mortality among children under five. The project seeks to expedite the introduction of immunization against these diseases in the 17 Central and West African countries that are members of La Francophonie, and to improve the decision-making process of local governments regarding vaccine planning and procurement in these countries.   Project activities include: (1) effectively supplying vaccines to the targeted countries; (2) providing targeted technical assistance to governments and the local population to strengthen their commitment to improve national decision mechanisms, to consolidate underlying health systems, and to ensure the success of systematic immunization; (3) to maintain and improve the quality of immunization data, to determine coverage rates and to work with countries to establish bases for estimates, and to propose support appropriate to the situations of the various countries. It is estimated that this project will help prevent nearly 23,000 premature deaths from rotavirus and 163,000 premature deaths from pneumonia due to the introduction of these vaccines in the countries targeted in 2014.   The project significantly complements efforts by Canada and the GAVI Alliance via the Advance Market Commitment for pneumococcal vaccine to fight pneumonia in children under five.","This project supports the short-term food needs of approximately 66,000 people (of which 60-70 % are women and children) in both displaced and host communities in Paniykang, Malakal, Nasir, Melut, Longochuk and Ulang counties of Upper Nile State, some of the most conflict-affected areas of South Sudan. The project distributes emergency livelihood kits, which include such items as farming tools, fishing equipment, cooking stoves and animal vaccines. The kits are designed to encourage large-scale emergency food production, protect agricultural related livelihoods and help reduce the level of food aid required to keep people alive during this critical period. The project also intends to provide training to ensure that the kit materials are used properly.","This project aims to improve the lives of more than 230,000 children and youth in disadvantaged communities in West and Francophone Africa using Sport and Play for Development and Peace (SPDP) programming. SPDP programming intentionally uses sport, physical activity and play to improve education, health, gender equality and child protection for vulnerable children and youth. Some project activities include: (1) implementing twice-weekly sport and play activities for children and youth, especially girls; (2) providing training for teachers, coaches, caregivers, and children and youth on the right to play, health, education, gender equality, inclusion and child protection; (3) providing core training and follow-up support to coaches, teachers, and partners to help them integrate sport and play methodologies into their coaching and daily teaching; (4) building and rehabilitating safe play spaces, classrooms and sanitation facilities, ensuring appropriate spaces for girls and women; and (5) conducting knowledge sharing and learning forums and meetings to share best practices in use of SPDP.   To ensure sustainability, the project also seeks to improve the ability and commitment of teachers, coaches, communities, national governments and key stakeholders to continue delivering sport- and play-based programs to children and youth at risk and to integrate SPDP methodologies into national development goals.","This project is part of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD) International Youth Internship Program (IYIP), funded by the Government of Canada's Youth Employment Strategy (YES). The IYIP contributes to the YES by providing a large spectrum of Canadian graduates with valuable international development work experience abroad, needed to launch successful careers.   Humber Institute Health and Private Sector Development project provides 20 interns with internships in ten countries: Bangladesh, Haiti, Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Peru, Nicaragua and Colombia.

It provides access for children and youth to primary health care, including sexual and reproductive health services. It supports 15 partner organizations from the “Réseau des Éducateurs pour les Enfants et Jeunes de la Rue” (REEJER) by providing training for staff and essential medications for the children. The project also seeks to disseminate best practices in health promotion and services for street children among the partner organizations and stakeholders in the REEJER network to establish standardized procedures. Project activities include: (1) providing up to 10,000 consultations in primary care and 1,000 for sexual and reproductive health; (2) referring 400 pregnant women, victims of sexual violence or HIV carriers to medical organizations and appropriate partners; (3) organizing six training sessions for staff of public health facilities in the reception and appropriate care for street children; and ( 4) strengthening the coordination structure between REEJER actors and the health sector to provide the most effective interventions.","This project aims to improve polio immunization coverage, particularly among children and vulnerable populations who are at high-risk of contracting the disease, to mitigate the risk and potential impact of a polio outbreak. Ukraine is at high risk for a polio outbreak because current rates of vaccination are low (less than 50% of children are fully immunized against polio) and the likelihood of exposure to sources of wild or vaccine-derived polio viruses is high. The project seeks to immunize the most vulnerable populations, including approximately 1.5 million children, with a focus on infants who have never been vaccinated, or who are living in conflict-affected areas or communities of internally displaced people.   Project activities include: (1) providing 1.8 million doses of Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and associated immunization supplies, as well as 3.1 million doses of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV); (2) vaccinating an estimated 450,000 infants under the age of one year with two doses of IPV - to the extent possible, followed in the next year with up to two more booster doses of OPV; and (3) vaccinating an older group of children who are only partially immunized against polio with additional doses of OPV.","This initiative wants to address the deficit in individual and collective practices in the prevention and identification of the EVD and other infectious diseases by the populations of areas at risk, including through prevention and community mobilization campaigns. The initiative also wants to address the shortcomings in terms of prevention, detection and protection in case of EVD among health workers, authorities and local stakeholders.","Título completo del proyecto: PROMOCIÓN DEL DERECHO A LA SALUD INFANTIL EN 15 COMUNIDADES DE MATAGALPA, NICARAGUA :: El proyecto implementa un programa de salud infantil en 15 del Departamento de Matagalpa en 3 pilares: 1.- Prevención, a través de un programa de vacunación masiva, desparasitación y aporte de hierro y vitaminas, así como la sensibilizaci´n sobre el derecho a la salud entre las familias. 2.- Diagnóstico, con la existencia de dispensarios médicos y un equipo de salud que pasa consulta y diagnostica enfermedades y casos de desnutrición, y 3.-El tratamiento: gracias a la existencia de una farmacia social, y un programa de recuperación nutricional","Título completo del proyecto: MEJORA DE LA ATENCIÓN DE LA SALUD SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVA Y SENSIBILIZACIÓN DESDE UN ENFOQUE DE DERECHOS, EQUIDAD DE GÉNERO Y GENERACIONAL EN EL MUNICIPIO DE LARREYNAGA-LEÓN :: Se pretende facilitar el acceso a servicios de salud sexual y reproductiva a mujeres, así como también información relacionada a la prevención de enfermedades de transmisión sexual (ITS) a hombres, mujeres jóvenes y adolescentes, desde un enfoque de derechos.

Desde una nueva siembra de plátanos, y con el tratamiento adecuado, podemos combatir los dos factores que nos impiden conseguir el autosostenimiento de los proyectos: la sigatoka amarilla (hongo que afecta a la hoja evitando así el proceso de la fotosíntesis), y el PH del suelo, elevándolo antes de la siembra a los niveles adecuados. Los problemas señalados anteriormente han provocado que hayamos descendido en la aportación de ingresos en terreno por este motivo en porcentajes muy preocupantes, poniendo en riesgo la continuidad de los proyectos que allí desarrollamos.","When approved to introduce a new vaccine, a country will receive a one-time cash grant to support a share of the additional costs related to the new introduction or delivery of the campaign, with the remainder being funded by the Government.

The mechanism was set up by DFID and Irish Aid. The activity period for Sida’s agreement with CARE comes to an end 31st August 2016.A number of cooperating partners are now interested in providing support to scaling up nutrition in Zambia and options are being explored regarding how to create a pooled funding mechanism for nutrition including how to increase the involvement of the government of Zambia. These deliberations are however still in their infancy. In order not to lose gains made in the project so far, Sida will consider extending its support to CARE as a bridging fund while the pooled funding arrangement is set up. Sida will consider whether to join the new pooled funding mechanism after the new strategy is agreed.The last joint review of the programme revealed that performance in the programme has picked up considerably over the past 6 months since the previously review. The programme scored an A on the basis of progress against milestones, showing clear improvement from the earlier review when the programme scored a B. This review however only focused on programme implementation and results and not much programme management aspects.A performance review of CARE is currently being conducted by the SUN Funds donors (DFID Irish Aid and Sida). There are indications of a number of challenges in the sub-granting particularly in the districts but it is difficult ascertain the extent to which these challenges are caused by shortcomings in CARE’s own systems. As part of the review Sida has proposed to conduct an organisational assessment of CARE with special emphasis on financial management, procurement and sub-granting. The goal of the organisational assessment is to evaluate whether CARE has appropriate systems, proficiency, capacity and routines to manage the SUN Fund resources and to direct its activities towards stipulated operational objectives and contribute to the fulfilment of the goals of the First 1000 Most Critical Days Programme and the SUN Fund. The results of this assignment will feed into the overall performance review of CARE and will be used to plan for possible programme extension.It is proposed that the organisational assessment is carried out by the Embassy’s auditors. The terms of reference of the assessment are attached.","We Effect frame agreement, Sida/CIVSAM, 2014-2016 and 2017","Plan Sweden's 3,5-year program for child rights is planned to be implemented in 19 country programs, four regional programs and one global advocacy and innovation program.

Samarbetsorganisationerna och rättighetsbärare inom utvalda målgrupper ska stärka sin kapacitet bl.a. för att bedriva påverkansarbete och utkräva sina rättigheter inom specifika tematiska områden. Deltagande är centralt.Urvalet av insatsmål har gjorts från länder i olika regioner i syfte att ge en bild av resultaten inom några av de vanligast återkommande ämnesområdena. Medvetet har insatsmål av varierande konkretionsnivå valts för att visa på skillnaderna mellan länderna. Sidas bedömning är att resultatramverket försvagas av att övergripande tematiska mål saknas. Målen i resultatregistret återges som de är formulerade i resultatramverket på engelska.","OPCs förändringsteori utgår från att samhällen förändras i en demokratisk riktning genom folkligt deltagande. OPC har utvecklat sin resultatmatris med utvecklingsmål på programnivå i respektive program-, projektland och de två tematiska programmen. Varje program bygger på målsättningar i syfte att stärka den samlade effekten av OPCs utvecklingssamarbete och för att möjliggöra uppföljning av resultat. Programländernas interventionslogik skiljer sig från projektländer och de tematiska programmen såtillvida att det inom programländer finns ett långsiktigt utvecklingsmål, ett programmål med olika delmål och till dessa utgångsvärden och indikatorer. Det saknas dock utgångsvärden i flera av delmålen. I projektländerna har vissa projekt endast angivits på ett övergripande sätt med angivet projektmål och samarbetsorganisation. Sammantaget ska insatserna leda till det övergripande målet genom att stärka folkligt deltagande och organisering för gemensamt påverkansarbete.  Inom t ex programlandet Filippinerna är det långsiktiga utvecklingsmålet att filippinska arbetare och marginaliserade grupper på Mindanao genom förbättrad organisering har stärkt sin röst och bidragit till en demokratisk utveckling på Filippinerna. Programmålet som anges: Filippinska arbetare och marginaliserade grupper på Mindanao har stärkt sin förmåga att tillvarata sina intressen och har ökat inflytande över sin situation. Genom att nya kollektivavtal tecknas antas att arbetares situation stärks. OPCs program på Filippinerna stärker arbetare och marginaliserade grupper genom att fokusera på deras rätt till organisering och väntas leda till ökat inflytande på såväl mikro- som makronivå. Inom exempelvis projektlandet Pakistan har OPC valt att samarbeta med pakistanska organisationer som har fredlig samvaro som en del av sina visioner, bedriver religiöst obundet arbete och är öppet kritiska till den religiösa, fundamentalistiska tendenserna. Ett av projektmålen är att kvinnor ska kunna, genom studiecirklar, utbildningar, erfarenhetsutbyte och kampanjer, både inom den formella och inom den informella sektorn, öka sitt fackliga och politiska engagemang.  Inom det tematiska Särskilda programmet har civilsamhällesorganisationer och grupper en särskild viktig roll att främja demokratisering och organisering av människor som vill förändra sitt samhälle. Syftet är att stärka förändringsaktörer i sex länder genom ökad kunskap i demokrati- och rättighetsfrågor och organisering. Sida kommer att följa upp OPCs resultatramverk i sin helhet, men har specifikt också valt ut tre insatsmål som syns i resultatregistret för att de anses representera utvalda målgrupper för OPCs program utifrån perspektiven ansvarsutkrävande, icke-diskriminering och facklig organisering. För mål två noterar Sida att detta insatsmål är av långsiktig natur. Sida bedömer att interventionslogiken är klar och att den kommer att bidra till att uppnå det övergripande insatsmålet.","The activity [Pingst FFS 2015-2017] does not have a description.

La tasa de prevalencia de anemia es muy alta entre las mujeres: 39,1% en el caso de las mujeres embarazadas, y 45,7% en el caso de las mujeres lactantes. Los niños/as de entre 6 y 59 meses también sufren altas tasas de anemia (25,6%). Esto se refleja en tasas de mortalidad superiores a las de los países desarrollados, la tasa de mortalidad de los menores de 5 años es de 27,2 por 1.000, y la tasa de mortalidad neonatal es de 15 por 1.000. En Gaza prevalece un modelo de sociedad patriarcal que coloca a las mujeres en una situación de subordinación y dependencia respecto a los hombres, una de las consecuencias del sistema patriarcal es la alta tasa de prevalencia de VBG: el 51% de las mujeres casadas sufre VBG. Para enfrentar esta problemática la intervención desarrollará las siguientes actuaciones: Se prestarán servicios de salud materno infantil a 600 mujeres embarazadas, 510 neonatos, 200 mujeres lactantes, 200 bebés lactantes, y 1.600 menores de 5 años hijos/as de las beneficiarias. El equipo médico identificará casos de VBG que se den entre el grupo de beneficiarias y los derivará al equipo de género, que dedicará una atención personalizada (incluyendo asistencia psicosocial y legal) a las mujeres y niños/as víctimas de VBG, para apoyarles en su lucha por salir de la situación de violencia en la que se encuentran. Se realizará un amplio trabajo de testimonio y protección orientado a garantizar la seguridad de las mujeres y niños/as víctimas de VBG. El equipo de género se coordinará con los representantes de las CLB, las representantes de las mujeres de Rafah, y determinadas instituciones (Municipalidad de Rafah, Ministerio de Asuntos Sociales, etc.) para que ejerzan una labor de interlocución con las familias a fin de eliminar cualquier tipo de amenaza sobre las mujeres que se han separado del marido agresor para escapar de la violencia. La intervención también contempla una acción de incidencia sobre las autoridades para conseguir que se establezca un nuevo marco legal que no discrimine a las mujeres y que penalice la VBG.","El proyecto ?Apoyo al programa de salud materno-infantil para la población refugiada de Palestina? tendrá lugar en Gaza, Cisjordania y Siria con una duración de 12 meses, dando comienzo el 1 de enero de 2015 y finalizando el 31 de diciembre de 2015","Título completo del proyecto: Acción humanitaria para mitigar la crisis crónica de salud púbiica y ambiental que afecta a 10.000 personas en Al Salam (Territorios ocupados palestinos) ::","Título completo del proyecto: Proyecto de mejora de la salud materno infantil y de erradicación de la violencia basada en el género en la Franja de Gaza ::","Ofrecer asistencia sanitaria primaria con 6 clínicas móviles a 55 localidades aisladas de Cisjordania, así como servicios de salud mental y apoyo psicosocial","Esta intervención, dentro del sector salud, pretende garantizar el acceso a servicios de calidad endoscópicos, de obstetricia y ginecología, a las mujeres palestinas en el norte de la Franja de Gaza (FdG), a través de la mejora, equipamiento y abastecimiento del Departamento de Obstetricia y Ginecología y de la Unidad de Endoscopia del Hospital Al Awda. Se fortalecerán ambos departamentos con recursos humanos y materiales suficientes (medicinas, equipos y combustible) para atender a 29.409 mujeres de 15 a 75 años (un 10% más que en el período anterior). Además se capacitará a 12 miembros del equipo médico del hospital Al Awda y a 120 mujeres de las CBOs, aumentando sus conocimientos y buenas prácticas en emergencia obstétrica y neonatal (control del embarazo, embarazo de riesgo y parto...), mejorando la capacidad de respuesta frente a las emergencias obstétricas dentro y fuera del entorno del hospital. Se realizará así mismo una campaña de sensibilización sobre los mismos temas y los derechos sexuales y reproductivos para las pacientes beneficiarias de los servicios de atención sanitaria.","La finalidad de este Proyecto es continuar el proyecto iniciado en 2014 para investigar el neurodesarrollo de los niños palestinos que viven en campos de refugiados así como evaluar el impacto que variables como la desnutrición y la exposición a la violencia pueden ejercer en los mismos.

Desde la Operación Margen Protector (verano 2014) esta crisis se ha agravado, afectando muy particularmente al sector salud mediante la destrucción de infraestructuras y el cierre de fronteras. El cierre del paso de Rafah a Egipto, que aliviaba las necesidades médicas de la población en el Sur de la FdG, ha empeorado la situación. Más grave es la afectación a la mujer, por la discriminación que sufre en todos los ámbitos de la sociedad gazatí, siendo sus necesidades relegadas a un segundo orden de prioridades. Frente a este contexto, la intervención da continuidad y mejora los servicios de atención integral a la mujer palestina del sur de la FdG que se proveen en el Centro de Salud Al Awda de Rafah, donde UHWC viene prestando atención sanitaria obstétrica y ginecológica, tratamiento psicológico, acompañamiento legal y psicosocial, así como campañas de sensibilización sobre derechos sexuales y reproductivos y violencia de género, entre otros. Para ello se rehabilitará la 2ª planta del Centro, convirtiéndola en una Unidad de la Mujer integral que garantice la atención de calidad así como la privacidad y confidencialidad de las beneficiarias. La nueva Unidad contará con 300 m2 habilitados para la prestación de servicios integrales a la mujer y será un espacio independiente del resto de servicios que provee el Centro. Contará con una consulta ginecológica y obstétrica con su sala de espera; un control de enfermeras y recepción; un almacén; dos aseos; una sala multifuncional para actividades de sensibilización; un gimnasio equipado; y tres despachos para una trabajadora social, una abogada y una psicóloga, que a su vez contará con una sala de espera propia para garantizar la privacidad de las beneficiarias que acudan en busca de ayuda psicológica, legal y social. La Unidad cubrirá las necesidades de uno de los sectores de la población más vulnerables en la FdG, las mujeres. No sólo aspira a proveerlas con una atención sanitaria especializada, sino a garantizar el acceso al ejercicio de sus derechos y a mecanismos de protección que contribuyan a mejorar sus condiciones de vida siguiendo las directrices de UNWOMEN y otros actores de referencia. La Unidad será un espacio en el que las mujeres encuentren protección y alivio. Por ello, adicionalmente se realizarán visitas domiciliarias a aquellas mujeres que por su especial situación de vulnerabilidad no puedan desplazarse a la Unidad. Las organizaciones comunitarias de base (CBOs) juegan un papel fundamental en la Unidad no sólo actuando de altavoz y catalizador de las sensibilizaciones sino además como instrumento de acceso a las mujeres de la comunidad en situación de máxima vulnerabilidad, que por unas u otras razones no han realizado un llamamiento de ayuda y por ende sufren un mayor grado de desprotección.","El proyecto de respuesta a crisis crónica se ejecutará en Al Khibet aladas (Rafah, Gaza). En el distrito de Rafah la tasa de pobreza llega al 47,2% y la tasa de pobreza aguda al 23,2%. La tasa de actividad de las mujeres es una de las más bajas del mundo (20%), el desempleo masculino es del 42,2% y el femenino es del 54,2%. El proyecto se focaliza en la salud materno infantil y en la lucha contra la VBG. En Gaza hay, permanentemente, 45.000 mujeres embarazadas, por lo que la salud materno infantil es la clave para garantizar el derecho a la sanidad de mujeres y niños/as. La tasa de prevalencia de anemia es muy alta entre las mujeres: 39,1% en el caso de las embarazadas, y 45,7% en el caso de las mujeres lactantes. Los niños/as de entre 6 y 59 meses también sufren altas tasas de anemia (25,6%). Aunque en los últimos años la tasa de mortalidad neonatal e infantil se han reducido, todavía el gap con los países desarrollados es muy elevado: la tasa de mortalidad de los menores de 5 años es de 26,8 por cada 1.000 nacidos vivos, y la tasa de mortalidad neonatal es de 13,50 por cada 1.000 nacidos vivos. La hegemonía de la ideología sexista y el predominio del modelo patriarcal son las causas de que la VBG presente unos niveles alarmantes: el 51% de las mujeres casadas sufre VBG. La intervención desarrollará las siguientes actuaciones: Se prestarán servicios de salud materno infantil a 600 embarazadas, 510 neonatos, 200 mujeres lactantes, 200 bebés lactantes, y 1.600 menores de 5 años. El equipo médico derivará los casos de VBG identificados al equipo de género, que prestará una atención personalizada a mujeres y niños/as de carácter multidisciplinar (incluyendo asistencia legal), y así dotar a las mujeres de herramientas de superación de la violencia. Se informará a las mujeres (y a sus maridos) de aspectos relacionados con el cuidado y educación de los hijos/as, la equidad de género, etc. Se realizará un amplio trabajo de Testimonio y Protección orientado a: Proteger a las mujeres (y sus hijos/as) que han roto la convivencia con el marido agresor, a través de una labor de interlocución con las familias que llevarán a cabo las CLB, las mujeres lideresas, la Municipalidad de Rafah, y el M. de Asuntos Sociales; Concienciar a la sociedad, a través de la base social de entidades gazatíes, sobre los derechos de las mujeres y la erradicación de la VBG; y Constituir un Observatorio permanente de evaluación de los avances en las leyes relacionadas con la VBG. El proyecto también contempla un curso de formación en textil para fomentar que las mujeres alcancen la independencia económica. Y, por último, el proyecto incluye la constitución de un Órgano permanente de interlocución con las familias y protección de las mujeres víctimas de VBG, y la realización de talleres de coordinación con diversas entidades (centro médico RSC, org. ambientalistas, proveedores de salud de Rafah, etc.) para garantizar el desarrollo exitoso de la estrategia de salida.","Este proyecto de ?Apoyo al programa de salud materna e infantil para la población refugiada de Palestina en Siria, Gaza y Cisjordania de un año de duración dará comienzo el 1 de enero de 2016 y finalizará el 31 de diciembre de 2016.

Methamphetamine is locally known as tik. Most heroin is smoked mixed with cannabis, a popular mix called whoonga, cocktail or nyope. Heroin injection, however, has been increasing in recent years. Harm reduction programmes were introduced in South Africa only in 2014, focusing on PWID. South Africa counts with a progressive legal framework around drug policies, supporting a harm reduction approach. Nevertheless, and despite being considered a middle-income country, government funding for harm reduction is still very limited. Moral issues around drugs play an important role in this disparity. With the help of Bridging the Gaps Program, in 2 years’time 3 Needles and Syringe Programmes (NSP) for People who Inject Drugs (PWID) were built and developed in 3 key-cities (Cape Town, Durban and Pretoria). Some of the activities offered by the programmes are HIV prevention and testing, needle and syringe distribution, drop in centres, and referral to other services. On the advocacy side, Mainline supports the development of two recently born regional drug users’networks, documentation of human rights violation towards PWUD, media articles on human rights for PWUD and national events to debate drug policies. One excellent example of such an event is the RUN 2016–SA Drug Policy Week–link: http://www.sadrugpolicyweek.com/. As a result of advocacy efforts, 3 new Opiate Substitution Treatment (OST) pilots will start in 2017 in Durban (Kwazulu Natal), Cape Town (Western Cape) and Pretoria (Gauteng). To support this, Mainline recently delivered a training on OST to South African outreach workers, together with our local partners. Training focused on understanding the medical aspects of OST and possibilities of psychosocial assistance for OST clients. Read more about the training here: http://english.mainline.nl/posts/show/10139/training-on-opiate-substitution-treatment-in-south-africa","Kenya (population 45 million) is an East-African country on the Indian Ocean that borders Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, South-Sudan and Ethiopia. Well known for its wildlife parks and safaris, it also has a history of terrorist attacks. Over the years, due to its strategic location, Kenya has become an important transit hub for heroin from South-East Asia. HIV has seriously affected the general population as well as key populations such as People Who Inject Drug (PWID), whose HIV prevalence is estimated to be over 18%. With the introduction of needle and syringe programs, harm reduction services first became available in 2011, followed by methadone treatment in 2014. Mainline started supporting local NGOs that work with drug users in 2012 in offering outreach services, Needles and Syringe Programmes (NSP), nutritional support, advocacy for health and human rights. Mainline started working in Kenya during the first Bridging the Gaps program in 2012.

We finance many innovative projects and often include partners in Pakistan in the implementation. Two of these partners are Nai Zindagi and the Association of People Living with HIV in Pakistan (APLHIV).","Nepal has a long history of drug use. Cannabis is sanctioned for use on certain religious occasions. The use of smoked opium has been quite common in the country. But drug use only began to be seen as a problem in the country in the mid-1960s and early 1970s with the influx of travelling hippies from Europe and the US. It is hard to find reliable data about (injecting) drug use in Nepal. A recent nationwide mapping study estimated the number of people who inject drugs (PWID) to be in the range of 30,155–33,742. Among the PWIDs surveyed, a high proportion noted sharing needles/syringes and few reported using condoms (HSCB and NCASC, 2011). The need for quality harm reduction services remains high in Nepal - despite comparatively low prevalence rates of HIV. Mainline works with its long-time partner Youth Vision in order to deliver clean needles and syringes and additional essential services through outreach workers in Kathmandu. Mainlines history in Nepal starts in 2006. Over the years, our partner Youth Vision specialised in the distribution of Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST). This work is still ongoing and Youth Vision secured funding for this from other sources. Mainline’s focus with Youth Vision shifted in 2016 to setting up an effective, high-quality Needle and Syringe Exchange (NSP).","Bridging the Gaps is an alliance of five Dutch NGOs, four global key population networks and more than 70 grassroots organisations bringing together a wealth of international expertise on key populations.

It is in this context that seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has the potential to become an important tool in the prevention of malaria.  SMC, achieved by administering up to four monthly doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ), or SP+AQ, is applicable in areas with high seasonal variation in malaria transmission and where resistance to SP+AQ is low, with the greatest opportunity for impact being in the Sahel.

In its effort to control the epidemic, Cuba has been innovative in seeking to reduce HIV infections since the mid-1990s, they have universal access to antiretrovirals (ARVs), and have expanded and tailored services to meet the needs of key populations and other vulnerable people. The overall goal of this program is to reduce the incidence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among key populations throughout the country, that is, transgender people, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), young people in the 20 to 29 year age group, and sex workers, with an emphasis on MSM. Additionally, there is a focus on youth within the 26 municipalities with higher HIV prevalence than the national average. Taking in account the programmatic gaps identified when designing the national strategic plan, the country selected three priority modules, two associated with preventative measures among key population groups and a third module to cover the gaps relating to the care, treatment and support provided to PLHIV. The Global Fund has supported HIV programs in Cuba since 2003 through two grants, implemented by UNDP, that have been focused on supporting the National Strategic Plan (NSP) and scale up of its activities.","A program description for the grant TKM-T-UNDP has not been provided.","HIV and AIDS is a major public health problem in the Republic of Djibouti: there is a generalized epidemic with an estimated prevalence level of 2.9 percent and concentrated among some population at higher risk (2014 IBBS study estimating the prevalence of HIV among female sex workers at 13%). With regards to tuberculosis (TB), Djibouti is ranked fifth in the world in terms of TB incidence and additionally, has a high incidence of TB/HIV co-infection. Furthermore, the level of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is estimated at 3.7 in new cases and 37.8 in previously treated cases, according to a newly conducted Drug Resistance Survey. This TB/HIV grant will focus on reducing new HIV infections by targeting both the general population and key populations, through behavioral change activities which will include condom promotion, counselling and testing, and diagnostic and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Moreover, the program will scale out access to treatment and care for people living with HIV, including pregnant women, children and co-infected patients. With regards to the TB component, the program aims at increasing the detection rate among the general population and key populations, such as refugees and prisoners. In addition, it will provide diagnostic, treatment and care for drug-resistant TB.","The Republic of Djibouti had reached a pre-elimination level of malaria in 2012 with just 24 confirmed cases (<1 case per 1,000 inhabitants), however the figures rose again to reach 1,674 in 2013 and 9,439 in 2014. The mapping of Malaria Risk in Africa (MARA) places Djibouti in an area of high epidemiological risk due to its unstable malaria transmission which is highly seasonal in nature, with variable peaks from north to south between October and March. The present program aims at strengthening the control phase of malaria in order to reach pre-elimination phase by 2020. It will provide testing and treatment for malaria, and vector control activities will be implemented across the country, namely Indoor Residual Spraying in the most affected areas, and distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) to the specific populations of refugees, migrants and nomads. Other target groups include pregnant women and children under five. As well as the strategies on vector control and case management, the program comprises an important component on health systems strengthening for monitoring and evaluation, and procurement and supply management.","A program description for the grant QMJ-C-UNDP has not been provided.","A program description for the grant QMJ-M-UNDP has not been provided.","A program description for the grant DOM-H-IDCP has not been provided.","Design of a new targeted five-year investment in health in Samoa.","A program description for the grant ERI-M-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant QNA-H-CDF has not been provided.","A program description for the grant QNA-T-CDF has not been provided.","A program description for the grant ETH-H-HAPCO has not been provided.","A program description for the grant ETH-M-FMOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant QNB-C-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant QNB-M-MoH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant TGO-T-PMT has not been provided.","A program description for the grant GEO-H-NCDC has not been provided.","A program description for the grant GEO-T-NCDC has not been provided.","A program description for the grant ROU-T-RAA has not been provided.","A program description for the grant GHA-H-ADRA has not been provided.","A program description for the grant GHA-H-GAC has not been provided.","A program description for the grant GHA-H-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant GHA-H-PPAG has not been provided.","A program description for the grant GHA-M-AGAMal has not been provided.","A program description for the grant GMB-H-ActionAid has not been provided.","A program description for the grant GMB-H-NAS has not been provided.","A program description for the grant RUS-H-OHI has not been provided.","A program description for the grant GUY-T-MOH has not been provided.","Grants to the Fiji Ministry of Health and World Health Organisation to purchase medical consumables, vector control needs, and communication costs to help Fiji combat a serious dengue outbreak.","This initiative contributes to funding the KITP until the end of 2018, by which time at least 44 interns are expected to have completed certification to enable them to practice within Kiribati.

Providing these countries with access to affordable, generic ARVs is critical to addressing the large unmet need for ART. Lack of generic availability and high branded prices for key ARVs have directly translated to restricted ART coverage and/or an inability to provide the best possible regimens for patients in the three target countries.  By addressing the legal and intellectual property barriers to generic market entry in the three target countries, this intervention aims to facilitate generic competition for key ARVs, which will lead to significantly lower prices. ITPC-MENA will organize national trainings on IP and access to medicines in each country to create knowledge and strengthen capacities of civil society groups. The project aims for national IP laws that are public health friendly and include all TRIPS safeguards.","HIV therapy keeps the virus under control, but does not provide a cure.

Men may be reluctant to visit the healthcare facilities for HCT for various reasons including lack of time due to work and fear of stigma. INERELA will address this testing gap by counselling men, including men who have sex with men (MSM) attending religious congregations in South Africa. MSM are an important key population in the South African HIV epidemic. This project has three stages:  1) Development of a training and implementation module for religious leaders (RLs) on sexuality, acceptance of sexual diversity, stigma eradication, importance of living openly and positively, HIV and HCT, 2) Train and support 20 RLs to implement the module in their congregations including the four-week build-up to HCT day, 3) Scale-up of the programme by requesting each RL to mobilize five other RLs in their local region, followed by training and implementation.","This project aims to set up the first prison intervention model for HIV prevention, care and treatment in Punjab, one of the highest HIV burden states in India.

Specific targeting and elimination of these cells is essential for HIV eradication, yet many basic questions about the composition of the latent reservoir are unanswered. As such, HIV infection of long-lived macrophages and microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) may present a major barrier to eradication strategies. This study uses unique material obtained from the CNS of patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and highly innovative brain cell culture systems, never before employed in parallel, to investigate if the CNS can serve as a potential reservoir for HIV. By whole genome deep-sequencing we will characterize the viral population as present in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) obtained from patients on cART with undetectable plasma viral RNA. Furthermore, HIV will be characterized in CSF and brain biopsies from patients who received a stem cell transplantation. Replication potential of these characterized viruses will be analyzed in brainderived macrophages, microglia, T-cells and brain slice cultures. Outcome of this study will provide novel insights in the role of the CNS as an HIV reservoir and will help to target future HIV eradication strategies.","AMC researcher, Theo Geijtenbeek, previously discovered that certain immune cells, so-called Langerhans cells, can destroy the HIV virus. The effectiveness of these cells, however, differs from person to person. Some women, for example, appear more susceptible to HIV than others. This research project aims to determine which factors play a role in destroying HIV.","The proposal will be implemented by RedLAM (Latin American Network for the Access to Medicines) comprised civil society organizations working in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The program aims to strengthen CS’s capacity to take action to overcome IP barriers to access to medicines. The main objective is to enhance quality of life of PLHIV by scaling up access to HIV/HCV treatment in Latin America region.To achieve this, the technical expertise of PLHIV communities, CS organizations and activists will be enhanced and developed. Public awareness of the negative impact of IP barriers on prices and access to ARV/HCV medicines will be increased.  And south-south cooperation among Latin-American activists working on IP issues will be improved.","This project seeks to increase the number of HIV positive adolescents ages 15-19 years in Region F of Johannesburg who know their HIV infection status and are linked to treatment and care.  The rate of new HIV infections has declined or stabilized in many populations, yet over a third of new HIV infections continue to occur among 15-24 year olds, and only half of South Africans in this age group have ever been tested for HIV. There is increasing interest in the role of incentives to modify health behaviors and encourage testing. Meanwhile, there is growing evidence that mobile platforms are an acceptable and feasible channel for the delivery of health promotion interventions, including sexual health promotion. The iloveLife program combines a sexual health promotion intervention delivered through a mobile platform with incentives to achieve sustained use and encourage positive behavior change including HIV testing. This project proposes to use and evaluate iloveLife to incentivize HCT uptake, refer adolescents to adolescent-friendly testing services near them, and identify and target areas of high adolescent concentration with mobile testing services, all to increase adolescents’ testing rates and HIV case finding and provide a scalable model for effective HIV testing.","Despite combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), perinatally HIV (PHIV)-infected children present with significant neurodevelopmental delays and cognitive impairments. The pathogenesis may partially differ from that in adults, as HIV does not only cause direct injury to the CNS, but may also impede the development of the pediatric brain. As we have recently shown, manifestations of HIV in the pediatric central nervous system (CNS) include brain volume reduction and white matter lesions, as well as widespread microstructural changes, such as poorer white matter integrity and alterations in cerebral metabolites. Evidence implies significant roles for ongoing neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction and hypercoagulability. Investigations combining neuropsychological assessment, multimodal neuroimaging and laboratory evaluation of inflammatory and neurodegenerative markers could greatly increase our understanding and improve treatment strategies. Longitudinal research will be crucial to observe and understand mechanisms underlying these long-term consequences of CNS exposure to HIV and cART as PHIV-infected survive into adulthood. In this study we will evaluate neurological and cognitive outcomes in a case-control cohort of PHIV infected children and sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status matched healthy controls at an interval period of four years. We will investigate potential mechanisms and factors (such as inflammatory and neuronal biomarkers) that may influence these CNS functions.","The project will use the omnipresence of mobile phones, and their inherent capacity to collect data and create personalized engagement to encourage at-risk HIV populations to get tested and seek care. Specifically, the project will target vulnerable populations to subscribe to a 6-month weekly audio magazine (24 issues) which will seek to educate its listeners on issues of relationships, sex and health. The magazine will also include surveys to collect demographic information about its listeners, as well as their changing knowledge, behaviours and attitudes towards sex and HIV. Finally, the audio magazine will encourage its listeners to get tested for HIV on a regular basis, and will offer specific content to those who might get tested and self-report being HIV-positive. This HIV-positive specific content will link patient with local clinics and enrol patients in a mobile-based reminder system for antiretroviral medication.","Research collaboration between the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and the Ndlovu Care Group in South Africa. Patient data from South Africa is used by Dutch universities and South African universities to conduct research on HIV and ageing- and prosperity-related disorders, such as diabetes. This project received funding from AmsterdamDiner proceeds in 2013 and 2014.","We know that those most affected by HIV are best placed to influence and shape the policies, laws and practices needed to end the AIDS epidemic in their country. PITCH is a strategic partnership between Aidsfonds, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs working with those most affected by HIV in enabling these groups to transform (inter)national HIV responses by strengthening their advocacy skills and capacities and promoting innovative evidence-informed practice. This will enable them to sustainably advocate for a more effective response to ensure all people have equal access to sexual and reproductive health services, including HIV-related services. For five years, these partners will jointly works towards ending the AIDS epidemic in the regions and countries most affected by HIV through an inclusive, in-country, in-depth approach to national and international lobbying and advocacy.PITCH is funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of their “Dialogue and Dissent” programme.","PrEP as a form of a biomedical intervention to reduce HIV infections is formally not yet available in the Netherlands, besides a trial executed by the H-Team in Amsterdam. Still PrEP has already become part of a discourse amongst MSM, and to an unknown degree also has been incorporated in sexual risk taking behavior. While PrEP is an issue for the general MSM population, internationally mobile MSM, defined as MSM attending circuit parties in the Netherlands and worldwide, have the highest likelihood of exposure to PrEP (either based on local availability e.g. in the US or Thailand, or by sexual partners on PrEP). The project aims to investigate PrEP-use attitudes and intentions among MSM, and associated sexual risk taking effects (for example use of condoms, but also risk taking strategies when having sex with PrEP-users while not being on PrEP oneself). Furthermore, given the lack of availability in the Netherlands, we investigate if and to what degree MSM are using Truvada® obtained from other PLHIV for their own intermittent PrEP. In sum, this project will map PrEP use intentions and existing unlicensed PrEP-use in the Netherlands and provide important psycho-social information highly relevant for current and future biomedical interventions.","Dr. Monique Nijhuis aims to characterize the latently HIV-infected viral reservoir in patients: How big is it, what is its composition and does the reservoir change during long-term antiretroviral therapy? Nijhuis also aims to determine the re-activation level required for the immune system to be able to recognise and eradicate these HIV-infected cells.","Immune dysfunction is a major problem in HIV-1-infected patients causing co-morbidities. Innate sensing of HIV-1 is crucial for induction of innate and adaptive immunity. However, HIV-1 evades or blocks innate sensing in immune cells, which prevents effective immunity to HIV-1 and might underlie the observed immune dysfunction. We have recently identified the RNA helicase DDX3 as a novel sensor for HIV-1 in dendritic cells. Strikingly, our novel data demonstrate that HIV-1 actively suppresses DDX3 function and antagonizing this HIV-1 suppression by inhibitors strongly enhanced antiviral immunity. Here we will identify the function of the RNA sensor DDX3 in dendritic cell subsets and macrophages, and investigate how we can target this sensor to enhance antiviral immunity to HIV-1. Remarkably, we identified a dual polymorphism in MAVS, a component of the novel HIV-1 sensing machinery, rendering the pathway insensitive to HIV-1 suppression in both dendritic cells and macrophages. Strikingly, this polymorphism is associated with lower viral replication in HIV-1-infected patients from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies for HIV-1/AIDS. Thus, preventing HIV-1 from blocking this novel RNA sensing mechanism will enhance antiviral immunity, limiting HIV-1 replication and potentially restore immune function in infected patients.","There is a constant and growing pool of lawyers, IP specialists and community activists who work on Intellectual Property issues, but they do so under difficult circumstances and with very limited resources. In addition, in many parts of the world, civil society is lacking the experience and technical knowledge needed to meaningfully engage at national and global level on questions of IP laws, TRIPS flexibilities and trade negotiations. Additionally, the existing national/regional advocacy initiatives led by civil society are not linked to each other and lack coordination to feed a global campaign aiming to advance the IP and access agenda at higher political level. With this funding, ITPC can play a coordinating role of the different efforts of civil society; bringing together the IP work, bridging the programs from different donors and most importantly increasing the impact of this work for people living with HIV. The project will focus on the following areas of work:- To build capacity on IP within civil society, especially in middle-income countries, in order to develop national strategies and engagement plans with governments, regional organizations and the generic and originator pharmaceutical industry.- To build greater solidarity among civil society organizations across the globe to pursue a common agenda and to facilitate inter-country and cross-organizational learning especially among countries that have engaged out of need, in these debates for some time and those who are just entering this stream of work.- To coordinate the many different actions at country level and in different regions and to ensure that lessons learned from these actions are understood to be part of a global advocacy campaign which addresses global policy makers, normative guidance agencies and donor agencies.","There is no drug that can cure HIV. The HIV virus can become latent and therefore difficult to eliminate. There are many ways latent HIV ‘hides’ in the DNA of our cells. One way is to hide in a cell’s folded DNA. The BAF complex is a group of proteins that play a role in the DNA folding process. EMC researchers aim to determine whether latent HIV can be re-activated by inhibiting the BAF complex.","In many countries in Asia conventional messaging around HIV testing does not reach men-who-have-sex-with men (MSM) and transgender populations. APCOM’s Test BKK-campaign, using new media and technologies, resulted in an increase of 38% in the research population group getting tested, a clear indication that the campaign, communication and data collection strategies worked. Although new media technologies can be used successfully to scale up HIV testing among MSM, unfortunately, cultural, social and local contingencies do not allow for an easy adoption in other countries. Tailoring is needed. To do so, APCOM would like to broaden the concept of campaigning, research, data collection and testing to other cities. In this programme APCOM will do so in China (Hong Kong) and Indonesia (Yogyakarta). The programme will start with a (social) media analysis in the proposed cities. APCOM will select the best media to target the groups and use a tailored HIV testing approach for the context. With the programme APCOM will determine if the culturally sensitive and contextually best possible media, research and data collection approach actually renders to more testing cases. Through the programme APCOM will compare success factors across locations, which will provide valuable information for future scaling up.","In the Netherlands, men who have sex with men (MSM) account for the largest fraction of new HIV diagnoses annually. Despite the availability of successful treatment, there is still ongoing transmission. Attention has focused recently on the following strategies: test and treat (TT), partner notification (PN), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The joint impact of combined strategies may be greater than that of each strategy alone, but strategies may affect each other's impact. Therefore, it is crucial to gain insights in the possible synergy or antagonism of TT, PN, and PrEP in order to optimize the allocation of resources into the most effective combinations of the three strategies and before enormous efforts and resources are consumed on conflicting strategies. To do that, we will investigate the individual and combined impact of TT, PN, and PrEP on HIV/STI transmission and assess their cost-effectiveness. We will develop an individual-based transmission model for HIV and other STIs and calibrate the model to empirical data. Results from the transmission model will be used in an economic model that includes quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and costs for each strategy. The strategies will be compared in terms of prevented HIV infections, QALY gains, incurred costs, and cost-effectiveness ratios.","There is an alarming increase in the prevalence of HCV infections in HIV-postive MSM. AMC researcher, Maria Prins, will study a focus group of MSM who are both HIV-positive and HCV-positive. This research project aims to determine the interplay between these two viruses, to identify the characteristics of the hepatitis C epidemic and HIV epidemic among MSM, and to determine the impact acute hepatitis C has on HIV.","Since combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) became available, AIDS mortality among HIV-infected people has decreased substantially. Anal squamous cell cancer (SCC) is a non-AIDS defining malignancy that is now one of the most frequent malignancies among HIV infected. Among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) its incidence is even higher than that of cervical cancer in unscreened female populations. Like cervical cancer, anal SCC is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and pre-cancer stages of anal SCC, i.e. anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), can be detected and treated. Unfortunately anal cytology is not suitable as a screening strategy because of its low sensitivity and specificity regarding high-grade AIN (HGAIN). In this project we will investigate whether a number of other promising biomarkers are predictive for HGAIN, i.e. persistent high-risk HPV infections; HPV anal viral load; and L1, E6, and E7 seropositivity. A cohort of 320 HIV-infected MSM from Amsterdam, who have been examined for HPV during a follow up period of 2 years, will be invited to undergo high resolution anoscopy. Abnormal tissue will be biopsied to make a diagnosis of HGAIN. Subsequently we will examine which of the selected biomarkers predict HGAIN.","A program description for the grant IDA-H-NACO has not been provided.","A program description for the grant IDA-H-PLAN has not been provided.","A program description for the grant IDA-H-SAATHII has not been provided.","A program description for the grant IDA-M-CARITAS has not been provided.","A program description for the grant IDA-M-NVBDCP has not been provided.","A program description for the grant IRN-H-UNDP has not been provided.","A program description for the grant JAM-H-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant RWA-M-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant SDN-H-UNDP has not been provided.","A program description for the grant SDN-M-UNDP has not been provided.","A program description for the grant SDN-T-UNDP has not been provided.","A program description for the grant KAZ-T-HOPE has not been provided.","A program description for the grant KEN-M-AMREF has not been provided.","A program description for the grant KEN-M-TNT has not been provided.","A program description for the grant SEN-M-IntraH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant SEN-M-PNLP has not been provided.","A program description for the grant SEN-S-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant KHM-T-CENAT has not been provided.","A program description for the grant LAO-M-GFMOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant LAO-S-GFMOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant LBR-H-PSI has not been provided.","A program description for the grant LKA-H-FPA has not been provided.","A program description for the grant LKA-H-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant LKA-M-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant LKA-T-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant TZA-C-STC has not been provided.","A program description for the grant TZA-H-MOF has not been provided.","A program description for the grant TZA-T-MOF has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UGA-C-TASO has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UGA-H-MoFPED has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UGA-M-MoFPED has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UGA-M-TASO has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UGA-S-MoFPED has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UGA-S-TASO has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UKR-C-AUA has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UKR-C-AUN has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UKR-C-UCDC has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UZB-H-RAC has not been provided.","A program description for the grant UZB-T-RDC has not been provided.","A program description for the grant VNM-H-VUSTA has not been provided.","A program description for the grant VNM-T-NTP has not been provided.","A program description for the grant YEM-M-NMCP has not been provided.","A program description for the grant ZMB-C-CHAZ has not been provided.","A program description for the grant ZMB-C-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant ZMB-M-CHAZ has not been provided.","A program description for the grant ZMB-M-MOH has not been provided.","A program description for the grant ZWE-M-MOHCC has not been provided.","A program description for the grant ZWE-T-MOHCC has not been provided.","The project will improve the livelihoods and food security of 4,496 poor people (below the Mozambican poverty line), including 1,068 people affected by leprosy/other NTDs and people with disabilities, through increased agricultural yields and diversity, and increased access to financial capital.

The Company is currently implementing an investment programme, aimed at  significant increase of its production capacities. The EBRD financing is  focused on the provision of the long term working capital which will enable the  full capacity utilisation of a modern production facility.  Given the specifics of the Client's key markets (CIS region accounting for  more than 60 % of the revenues), EBRD is uniquely positioned to cater to the  Company's working capital needs and provide a multicurrency credit line.  The proceeds of the EBRD loan will help the Company in: (i) providing working  capital with adequate tenor and currency during the Company's expansion period,  (ii) optimising the financing structure, (iii) decreasing financial risk and  strengthening the risk management operations.","On 24 November 2016, the Bank signed a project with the City of Amman to  finance priority solid waste investments in Amman (the Project).

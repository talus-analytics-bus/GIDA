# Overview

The data/ subdirectory includes the following folders:
* ihme/  
* crs/  
* gavi/  
* gfinder/  
* oie/  
* aggregate/

The folders ihme, crs, gavi, gfinder, and oie all contain row and processed data from the datasources specified. Note that not all raw data has been pushed to git (intentionally, as these files can be large and do not need to be shared at this time). The folder aggregate/ contains aggregate data that incorporates data from ihme, gavi, gfinder, and oie (but not crs at this time). The code contained in another directory, src/, was used to process the data contained in the source-specific subfolders and generate the data contained in the aggregate folder.

The data/ subdirectory also includes the following files:  
**field_mapping.tsv:** indicates how individual fields in each dataset map to a set of conserved core data elements  
**agency_country_mapping.tsv:** identifies the countries associated with a subset of agencies included in demo dataset  
**demo_data.tsv:** dataset used for demo, combining both notional and actual data  

Specific Information regarding each subdirectory is included below.

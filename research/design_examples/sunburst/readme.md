Notes:
* Central text should be face-up (text in center circle)
* Extend length of bars so that text doesn't run over them
* Choose better colors, outside colors (indicators) should be a ligher shade of the same general color as indicate colors (core elements). E.g. If "Prevent" is read, "Immunization", "Food Safety", etc, should be pink
* Consider printing numbers next to labels
* Don't allow users to drill-down the lowest level of the hieracy by itself (e.g. can't select only immunization)
* Could consider adding individual projects as a lower level of hierarchy (e.g. "specific Gates Foundation Project for Immunization")
* If text is too small, render as part of a hover-over, don't automatically print text
	- however, ALWAYS print text for prevent, detect, respond, and other, no matter how small text is

Notes:
* Central text should be face-up (text in center circle)
* Extend length of bars so that text doesn't run over them
* Choose better colors, outside colors (indicators) should be a ligher shade of the same general color as indicate colors (core elements). E.g. If "Prevent" is read, "Immunization", "Food Safety", etc, should be pink
* Consider printing numbers next to labels

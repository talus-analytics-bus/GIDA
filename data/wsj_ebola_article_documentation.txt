An article published on March 30, 2018 in the Wall Street Journal drew attention to 
the Ebola Recovery Tracking Initiative formed by the office of Paul Farmer, the U.N. secretary-generalâ€™s 
special adviser on Community-Based Medicine and Lessons from Haiti. Data were extracted from 
the Ebola Recovery Tracking Initiative.

Of note, the Ebola Recovery Tracking Intiatives uses the following defintions:
Pledge: "a general promise to provide assistance and is usually made for a particular time frame, though not always." 
Commitment: "Committed (or obligated) funds are those for which projects have been approved or agreements/contracts have been signed or are in the process of being transferred or disbursed. Committed funds are exclusive of disbursed funds."
Disbursal: "Disbursement is the transfer of funds from a donor to implementing partners (which could be governments, non-governmental organizations, UN entities, or private contractors, among others)."

We only incorporate data on commitments (official agreements) and not on pledges (non-official agreements).
Coded data from the European Commission as data from the European Union, based on existing data coding from other sources (EC is part of EU)

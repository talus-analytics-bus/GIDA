        <div class="description">
            Global health security requires international and cross-sector partnerships to effectively prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. Ensuring adequate funding for health security initiatives is critical for the advancement of global health security, and requires awareness of the current status of funding. To identify funding requirements, develop a compelling case for investment, and prioritize future funding decisions, it is necessary to understand who is funding what, and where, in the broad context of global health security.
            <br>
            <br>The global health security tracking dashboard was developed to provide a shared resource which maps the flow of committed and disbursed funds for global health security. This dashboard will allow both funders and recipients to identify gaps and prioritize future investments, and will help to highlight the ways in which funds can be allocated most effectively to have the greatest impact. This platform and effort will serve as the basis for mutual accountability within the global health security community, promoting public accounting, and providing an opportunity for countries, organizations, and other funders to showcase their successes and identify priorities for future investments.
            <br>
            <br>The global health security tracking dashboard was developed by Talus Analytics and the Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security. This project was funded by a grant to Georgetown University by the Open Philanthropy Project.

        <h3>Data Sources</h3>
        <div class="description">
            The global health security tracking dashboard currently aggregates data from the International Aid Transparency Initiative, a compendium of projects related to Article X of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, the 2018 US Global Health Security Agenda Progress and Impact Report, the Ebola Recovery Tracking Initiative, the Nuclear Threat Initiative Commitment Tracker, and the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies.
